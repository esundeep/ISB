At least that’s what Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely informs the country. According to him, “virtually” all states have agreed to GST, except Tamil Nadu. There was no word on Jammu and Kashmir, which had said even last year that it was unlikely to comply with the GST regime because it would take away the state’s exclusive authority on tax legislation. For J&K, it’s about the unwillingness to give up its special powers; or in simple terms, its autonomy as a state. File photo of J Jayalalithaa. PTI That’s the problem with Tamil Nadu too. Its reasons for resisting a uniform countrywide tax system that will subsume a host of national and state taxes is this fear. It may appear economic — or rather its manifestations might be economic — but the real reason is political. When J&K flags special powers and suggests resource-sharing instead of revenue sharing for effective “cooperative federalism” than “coercive federalism”, Tamil Nadu’s apparent fear is the loss of autonomy than loss of revenue when the country steamrolls uniform systems on an un-uniform country. The Union Government has been insisting that it would compensate for the loss of revenues in the states for five years (100 percent for the first three years, and 75 percent and 50 percent in the fourth and fifth years respectively) by which time the GST would have been established. That may be fine with the consuming states, which obviously would only gain from its share of a uniform tax, but Tamil Nadu is a manufacturing state and hence losing the power of collecting taxes at origin is a loss of an upper hand that it had assiduously built over the years. Compensation of losses cannot replace that sense of autonomy. In fact, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s explainer on Tuesday on why the state is not happy with the GST betrays this apprehension. Among her concerns, the foremost seems to be about the GST council, the constitutional body that will be set up to govern the new regime. And it’s political. According to her , the Council would jeopardise the autonomy of the state in fiscal matters and would also impinge on the legislative sovereignty of the state because the decision-making and voting weight give the Centre the upper hand and “an effective veto”. More over, there is no distinction among the states in weight, which she feels should be based on their respective representation in Rajya Sabha. As the chief minister of the country’s second largest economy and the second most industrialised state, where the industrial growth far exceeds the national average, she is justified in being protective about her political and economic autonomy. There is no need for federal parity at the cost of the state’s interests. also see Sasikala must resist temptation to be Tamil Nadu CM; sycophancy has to be timed well in politics To end black money in political funding, Modi govt must do more than blame old law GST council meeting: FM Jaitley 'trying best' for 1 April rollout even as logjam continues As she says, the GST has different implications on different states based on the size and reliance on tax-revenues. Some have nothing to lose and only to gain and hence easily accede to a uniform system, while others, which are origins of wealth fear a justifiable sense of loss. “It is quite clear that a manufacturing state like Tamil Nadu will permanently lose substantial revenue if GST is implemented, due to the shift of the levy from the point of origin to the point of destination and also due to the phasing out of central sales tax and the transfer of input tax credit on inter-state sales and inter-state stock transfers to the destination states. Due to the difficulty in fixing even nominally high revenue-neutral rates, it is expected that the extent of revenue loss under GST would be around Rs 9,270 crore for Tamil Nadu,” Jayalalithaa said. On the demand of keeping petroleum and petroleum products out of the ambit of GST permanently, Jayalalithaa is not alone. For TN, along with Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, it’s a huge earner. It accounts for about 20 percent of the sales tax collections in these states, which in fact top the list . The scale and relevance of this sector was noted in TN’s interim budget presented in February, which said the loss from Petroleum taxes because of falling prices and poor realisation alone set the state’s revenue back by Rs 4000 crore. TN’s consent without a hard bargain will be a compromise on whatever autonomy, even if it’s psychological, it can retain. Similarly, its position on tobacco is also well placed because states should be allowed to tax tobacco and liquor freely - even punitively. GST may or may not work the way it has done elsewhere in the world, particularly in rich countries. It may widen the tax base and reduce the overall tax burden, may spur economic growth and lead to more tax revenues; but the fear of TN, with its hard-earned political and economic autonomy is not misplaced because India is not Australia or Canada. It’s the state and local administrations that deliver services to the people of India, and not the Centre, and hence TN cannot give up even part of its autonomy without a debate. It’s a state that always stood up to attempts of socio-political homogenisation. Resistance to GST is a reflection of this awareness and an assertion of its multi-faceted autonomy.

Written by Subhomoy Bhattacharjee | New Delhi | Updated: August 19, 2014 10:17 am Currently, the Centre collects this inter-state tax on behalf of all the states and distributes it among them. (Thinkstock) The Gujarat government has asked for the right to collect central sales tax in perpetuity, potentially crippling the rollout of the nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST). The proposal comes just days before the Centre and states discuss a model for taxation of interstate movement of goods (IGST). Gujarat has told the Centre that it should be allowed to deduct the 2 per cent tax levied on all goods that leave state borders to be sold elsewhere. For instance, cars manufactured at Maruti and Tata factories in Sanand, but sold in Delhi. Currently, the Centre collects this inter-state tax on behalf of all the states and distributes it among them. The GST structure which is being finalised is meant to abolish this origin-based tax for a destination-based tax. To make the switchover easy, all states are supposed to get a compensation amount over the next few years. But the Gujarat model placed before the empowered committee of state finance ministers puts a spanner in the works as it ensures that the origin-based tax, biased in favour of manufacturing heavy states, will continue in perpetuity. For instance, it will force a recalculation of the rates for the GST in the bills that are to be placed in the winter session of Parliament. Equally important, if this model is adopted, one more constitution amendment bill will be necessary to redraw the powers of taxation for the Centre and the states. State Finance Minister Saurabh Patel, in his note, has demanded that Gujarat be allowed to levy the central sales tax at the source. In return, the state will ask the Centre to recalibrate the compensation amount it would have got. Manufacturers will be given credit by the state, independent of the central government’s GST machinery for the sales they make outside the province. Crucially, the right to phase out the inter-state tax will pass from the Centre to the states under the Gujarat model. “This is now the biggest obstacle we have on the GST issue. It will entirely damage the model,” a source said. In last year’s budget, the Centre had provided Rs 9,300 crore as compensation to states, though only Rs 1,940 crore was disbursed. Central government sources said that the proposal, which is totally at variance with the Maharashtra model, has drawn interest from some other manufacturing rich states such as Tamil Nadu, and may force the GST plans back to the drawing board. Gujarat has argued that it is not convinced that the compensation mechanism being drawn up by the Centre will be adequate for the tax it will forgo on interstate movement of goods. Indirect tax expert and consultant to the Finance Ministry on GST issues, S Madhavan, described the Gujarat plan as a bad idea. “It will lead to perpetuation of origin-based tax from which we are trying to move away. The finance minister and his team must stand firm against it.” In the Budget for 2014-15, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had referred to the apprehension among some states to surrender their taxation jurisdiction. “I assure all states that the (central) government will be fair in dealing with them,” he had said. But despite the assurance, Patel has made the fresh demand, taking away the right of the Centre to determine the end of the most important bottleneck for the GST to become a reality. The budget has not drawn up any amount as CST compensation since the mechanism is still in the works. Phasing out this tax has been highly controversial as the manufacturing states have demanded higher compensation while consuming states have objected to it. The Gujarat model, by seeking to take away the Centre’s rights on the tax, could make the GST almost impossible to reach.

Drag according to your convenience ET NOW RADIO ET NOW TIMES NOW Here is why Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa does not want GST By Bharani Vaitheesvaran , ET Bureau | Updated: Jun 16, 2016, 12.08 PM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » tamil nadu | services tax | OTR | Narendra Modi | madras school of economics according | J Jayalalithaa | GST Council RELATED VIDEO Here is why Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa does not want GST CHENNAI: As Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa 's renewed slant towards welfare and reluctance to support the Goods and Services Tax becomes prominent, experts in the state worry about the future. Economists and observers believe Tamil Nadu runs the risk of being forced to increase its borrowing and hit the fiscal-deficit ceiling to fund a ballooning budget for welfare schemes from free laptops to low-priced food canteens as the proposed GST will take a significant chunk of Own Tax Revenue (OTR) for the manufacturing state. ""If Tamil Nadu takes up GST, they may have to either borrow money or give up some of the schemes. While it will be tough to say which route the state will take, it is for sure the GST in its current form will significantly add to the state's revenue deficit,"" said professor KR Shanmugam, former director of Madras School of Economics. According to a study done for the state commercial taxes department by economists from the Madras School of Economics, Tamil Nadu stands to lose Rs 9,270 crore a year upon implementation of the GST. The government gets well over 70% of state's OTR - primarily through sales tax and state VAT - which was estimated at Rs 95,531 crore in the interim budget presented in February . Being a hub of manufacturing with clusters of textile, automotive, leather and pharmaceutical factories, Tamil Nadu consumes relatively lesser than it manufactures, meaning it will lose revenue as the GST law shifts points of tax levy from origin to where the good or service is utilised. ""Due to the new GST procedure, more dealers are going to be ex empted from taxation, the central sales tax will be slowly phased out and so will Tamil Nadu's inherent nature of being a producing state,"" he said. In hailing of the progress of the GST law as a landmark move in the country on Tuesday , finance minister Arun Jaitley said Tamil Nadu was the lone state not on the wagon yet. In her meeting with PM Narendra Modi , Jayalalithaa said the pricky issues were the GST Council impacting state autonomy on its finances and pushed for the centre compensating all of its revenue loss. He added Tamil Nadu's fears are well-founded owing to clash with the Centre over the revenue loss.The empowered group of finance ministers put the revenue loss at just Rs 2,000 crore.

After president Pranab Mukherjee gave his assent on September 8, 2016, the Government is firing on all cylinders to implement GST by April 1, 2017. However, the implementation will be little early for the existing tax payers. The existing taxpayers will have to enroll themselves under the GST database by the end of this month. Goa’s state government has already issued a deadline of November 29, 2016, and asked all the existing tax payers in the state to enroll themselves on www.goacomtax.gov.in. Who all are liable to enroll? Existing taxpayers are liable to enroll under GST system portal. An existing taxpayer is an entity registered with any of the authorities; Central Excise Service Tax State sales tax/VAT (except exclusive liquor dealers) Entry tax Luxury Tax Entertainment tax Further enrollment here means validating the data of existing taxpayers and filing up the remaining key fields. Which is the final date of enrollment? If you are a taxpayer in Goa, then you should read the notification and get yourself enrolled before November 29, 2016. For rest of India, the dates have also been announced. The table is as follows: STATES START DATE END DATE Pondicherry, Sikkim 08/11/2016 23/11/2016 Gujrat, Maharashtra, Goa, Daman and Diu, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Chhattisgarh 14/11/2016 29/11/2016 Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram 30/11/2016 15/12/2016 Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Chandigarh, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan 16/12/2016 31/12/2016 Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh 01/01/2017 15/01/2017 Service Tax Registrants 01/01/2017 31/01/2017 Delta All Registrants (All Groups) 01/02/2017 20/03/2017 Procedure for enrollment under GST System Portal #Point 1 – Paperless procedure: The whole system of enrollment will be paperless; hence, no hard copies shall be entertained by the department.

In Goa, all the registered taxpayers will have to visit the government office between November 9 and November 11, 2016, to collect sealed envelope containing the provisional ID and password. The provisional ID format is here as under: Hence, contact your ward officer to complete the online pre-registration under GST. #Point 3 – Documents and information required: To complete the registration procedure, you must have the following information: Provisional ID as explained in point 2.

Save that number for future correspondences. Here are some points which may help you during enrollment process: What to do in case I have not received the ID and password? In case you have not received the provisional ID and password, kindly contact your concerned authorities. Who can be primary authorised signatory? A primary authorised signatory is the person who is primarily responsible to perform action on the GST System Portal on behalf of the taxpayer. All communication from the GST System Portal relating to taxpayer will be sent to him. For example, in case of proprietor, the proprietor himself or any person authorised by him; in case of partnership, any of the partner authorised or any person authorised; in case of Company/LLP, Society, Trust, the person who is authorised by Board or Governing Body, etc., can act as primary authorised signatory. A copy of authorisation needs to be uploaded. Which details are prefilled in the enrolment application for enrolling with GST? Following details are auto-populated in the enrolment application based on your existing data: PAN of the business Legal name of the business State Reason of liability to obtain registration Email and mobile number Can I make changes in in my legal name, state name and PAN in the enrolment application? You cannot make changes to legal name, state name and PAN as appearing in the enrolment application. These details have been migrated from existing tax systems of State or Center, as the case may be. Conclusion GST is now a reality and it is far more complex and stringent when it comes to compliance. Enrollment is only a procedural aspect; however, the real game will begin from April 1, 2017.

4," Why states still fear goods and services tax OPEN TO OPINION POLITICS ART & CULTURE LIFE MONEY HUMOUR VARIETY VIDEOS VOICES Why states still fear goods and services tax A Constitution Amendment Bill to introduce GST has just been passed by Lok Sabha, but states are apprehensive about the impact of the new tax regime. 628 POLITICS | Macro Matters | 5-minute read | 08-05-2015 Tina Edwin @tinaedwin Share The Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014, commonly referred to as the GST Bill, and now known as the Constitution (100th Amendment) Bill, 2015, cleared its first hurdle in the Lok Sabha with ease. The Bill is now due to be discussed and taken up for voting in the Rajya Sabha on Monday. Many regional parties have extended support to the landmark bill, yet it does not mean that all apprehensions of states have been addressed by the Union government. Two major concerns continue to rankle states as was apparent from the debate in Lok Sabha: loss of revenue and loss of fiscal autonomy. Foremost among continuing worry is loss of revenues, despite assurances that all losses will be compensated. It is the manufacturing states that are more worried than the others. This is because value added tax, or VAT, the current taxation regime in states, is an origin-based tax while the good and services tax (GST) is a destination-based tax. In the origin-based tax system, tax is collected where the supplier of good is located while in the destination based system, tax in collected where the consumer of a product is located. Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat are among the more industrialised states and they fear big losses of revenues on movement of goods made in their states. The Constitution amendment assures them compensation for losses suffered in the first five years, but some states want to be compensated for ten years. States have been assured 100 per cent compensation for losses suffered in the first three years and 75 per cent in the fourth year and 50 per cent in the fifth year. However, the finance ministry expects that all states will not need compensation for five years. Consuming states in particular may see their revenues increase with the implementation of GST. To address the fears of revenue loss of manufacturing states, the union government has said additional tax of up to one per cent would be collected on inter-state trade of goods for two years or longer period if the centre-state body, the GST Council, so decides and be transferred to the states. This is in lieu of the central sales tax (CST) that stands abolished when GST is implement. Tamil Nadu, for instance, estimates its losses from scrapping CST will be Rs 3,500 crore annually. Currently, inter-state sales of goods attract two per cent CST. Many states fear, and that’s a fear shared by businesses too, that this one per cent tax will have cascading effect on transactions, even though the union finance minister has assured them that it will not. They worry this tax will be levied every time a good travels from one state to another and therefore it will work out to more than one per cent. For instance, if a good travels through three states from the point of manufacturing to the point of consumption, going from one warehouse to another, each of the three states would levy the one per cent tax taking it to three per cent, and thus increase the cost in the supply chain. The Centre estimates that the states are being over-anxious about revenue losses that would arise from transition to GST from the current VAT system. Finance ministry expects that revenues generated by states from taxing services will more than make up for losses they suffer when octroi and entry tax, entertainment tax, luxury tax and other state level taxes are subsumed by GST. Maharashtra, which is set to lose Rs 14,000 crore that it collects as octroi, is expected to gain from taxing services, according to finance minister Arun Jaitley. Some states are also keen to tax tobacco. Although tobacco is within GST, the Centre has retained powers to levy additional excise duty of tobacco and tobacco products. States too want similar power to levy additional tax on tobacco and tobacco products to generate more resources for themselves. It may be noted that Centre has agreed that GST on petroleum crude and products will be held in abeyance till such date that the GST Council decides. Until then, states are free to levy VAT on sale of petroleum crude and products. The other big concern among states is the loss of fiscal autonomy. States will not be allowed to introduce any new tax at will, change the rate of tax or give exemptions to any class of goods or service provider. They are also not allowed to unilaterally levy cess or surcharge or increase tax rate to raise resource in the event of a natural calamity. Any change to tax rates will have to be within a narrow band prescribed by the GST Council. They also have to give up all the state level taxes they currently levy when GST comes into force. Any changes to the tax rate will need to be agreed to with three-fourth majority at the GST Council. While states together have weightage of two-third in any decision and Centre will retain the balance one-third. This effectively means that states together will not be able to act on their own or take any decision, consent of the Centre will be necessary. This is akin to giving the Centre veto power. The Centre will hopefully assuage the concerns in the subordinate legislations that are need to give effect to GST and when the tax rates at the Centre and state are decided. Once the Constitution amendment is cleared by Rajya Sabha and the state assemblies, Parliament needs to pass a Central GST Act and the states a State GST Act. Also, an integrated GST Act to cover inter-state movement of goods need to be passed. #Goods and services tax , #Arun Jaitley , #VAT , #GST The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

New Delhi: Highlights PM Modi had opposed GST as Gujarat chief minister I had discussed my doubts with Pranab Mukherjee many times: PM Modi Lok Sabha unanimously voted in favour of GST on Monday Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in parliament on Monday that his experience as a chief minister who had doubts about the Goods and Services Tax, made it easier for him to address those issues as Prime Minister. Opposition leaders, while pledging support to India's biggest tax reform, have repeatedly taunted PM Modi about his opposition to GST, first scripted by the Congress-led UPA government, when he was Gujarat chief minister and his party, the BJP, was in opposition. In a discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday , Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""Those who are passing the GST now, why were they opposing it when they were in the opposition? ""I had many doubts. I had discussed it with Pranab Mukherjee many times,"" PM Modi said in his speech during the discussion, referring to the President who was then Finance Minister in the UPA government. ""As Prime Minister, having the experience of a Chief Minister, I could easily address the concerns on GST,"" PM Modi said. He said there was a crucial need to develop confidence among states on GST as many of them had apprehensions over the centre compensating them for loss of revenue. Because GST is applied at the time of consumption, producing states like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat fear they will rack up losses. In both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, Tamil Nadu's ruling party, the AIADMK, staged a walk out in protest before the vote on GST. On Monday evening, after the six-hour debate, the Lok Sabha unanimously voted in favour of the constitutional amendment bill that enables GST, a single national tax that will replace a raft of different state and local taxes. The Prime Minister noted that a ""lot of flaws have been overcome"" in the provisions of GST, detailing how it will benefit states, and said he alone could not take credit for that, thanking parties for their support to enable what has been described as his biggest victory since the 2014 election. One party had ""birthed GST and another brought it up,"" the PM said, emphasising that GST ""can't be seen as a victory of a party or government, it is a win for the democratic ethos of India and a victory for everyone."" After the vote, the PM walked up to opposition leaders and shook hands with them.

Gujarat had flagged this issue during the UPA government, and is now seeking as compensation at least 2 per cent out of the Centre’s share of the Inter-state GST (IGST) collections. Gujarat raised the issue at a meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers in Delhi on Wednesday. The Chairman of the Empowered Committee, Jammu & Kashmir Finance Minister Abdul R. Rather, told The Hindu, “Gujarat raised the issue of compensation for IGST for manufacturing States of 2 per cent but the Modi government is yet to come back to us on it.” The other manufacturing State that has raised the compensation issue is Tamil Nadu with Chief Minister Jayalalithaa writing to the Prime Minister recently. IGST collections will arise from the proposed tax on the sale of goods and services produced in one State but consumed in another. The Centre and the States where the sale takes place will share the IGST collections. Gujarat wants some part of such collections to be shared with the States in which the products are made.

A team of officials from the State government and Invest India led by Gujarat Resident Commissioner Bharat Lal met U.S. business leaders and lawmakers this week in several cities. The passage of the Goods and Services Tax Bill recently has added strength to all Indian efforts to woo American investors. The Modi government had inspired a lot of hope among American businesses initially but it did not last and the disappointment was reflected even in the State Department report on global investment climates early this year. The GST Bill has turned around the situation, and investors increasingly look at India more favourably, consequently. Addressing a luncheon organised by the U.S.-Indian Business Council (USIBC), Mr. Lal pointed out that the GST law indicated the political consensus that has emerged in India in favour of reforms. “Not only that Parliament passed the law with the cooperation of all major political parties, more than half of the State legislatures have approved it in record time, meeting the threshold for the Constitution amendment. This shows that across parties and across States, there is larger support for reforms,” Mr. Lal said. “GST has convinced American companies that the Modi government is serious about reforms and is capable of doing it,” said Mukesh Aghi, President, USIBC. USIBC member companies have invested $ 28 billion in India in the last two years and investments of $ 45 billion are in the pipeline. Secretary of State John Kerry had led the U.S. delegation to Vibrant Gujarat in 2015, the first after the Modi government came to power. Since the U.S. administration will be in transition early next year, with a new President taking office only in January, participation of federal officials may be unlikely in 2017 and the focus is on getting governors of key States in the country and business leaders such as Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos has plans to expand Amazon further in India, and had attended Mr. Modi’s address to the U.S. Congress in June. Ahmedabad, new hub In the second edition of Vibrant Gujarat after Mr. Modi became Prime Minister, the thrust of the State officials is not limited to projecting the State, but the entire country. Mr. Lal, a confidant of Mr. Modi, places the efforts to project Gujarat within the broader picture of the country. At the centre of this effort is showcasing Ahmedabad as a new financial centre in Asia. The Gujarat International Financial Tec-City (GIFT) opened operation four months ago. “We hope this will emerge as a centre of financial services, competing with Dubai. Its performance over the last four months has been encouraging,” he said. GIFT has physical and technological infrastructure that is of global standards, Mr. Lal said. Deepak Bagla, CEO of Invest India, the national investment promotion agency, pointed out that only a handful of Indian States grow above the national average right now, but other States are acting with urgency to catch up. “When 29 States catch up with the leading States, its impact on growth is going to be immense.” A group of Indian parliamentarians, sponsored by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), also met with a cross-section of the Washington policy elite this week, and sought to sell the India story, highlighting the GST Bill. The group comprising Baijayant Panda (BJD), Anurag Thakur (BJP) Harish Chandra Meena (BJP), Neeraj Shekhar (SP), Jayadev Galla (TDP), Rajeev Satav (INC), Sushmita Dev (INC) met U.S. lawmakers, scholars at think tanks and universities and U.S. government officials.

8," GST Impact And The States - Tax - India We use cookies to give you the best online experience. By using our website you agree to our use of cookies in accordance with our cookie policy. Learn more here . Close Me Home > India > Tax India : GST Impact And The States Last Updated: 10 October 2016 Article by Rakesh Nangia and Rajat Mohan Nangia & Co Introduction GST, which is considered as biggest tax reform since 1947 which seeks to replace a slew of taxes and levies in 29 states and aims to simplify and harmonise the indirect tax regime in the country. Implementation of GST will bid farewell to the different indirect taxes that are currently applicable in different states, thereby bringing about uniform taxation across states. GST is seen as an economic unifier that brings all the states and the centre together. This is going to be a regime that transcends all borders within the country. How will a transaction be taxed simultaneously under Dual GST within a state? The Central and State GST would be levied simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and services except on exempted goods and services which are out of the purview of GST and are below the prescribed threshold limits. Further both would be levied on the same price unlike State VAT which is levied on the value of goods that is inclusive of central excise. Seamless credit of input tax paid in earlier stages will facilitate removal of cascading effect and lead to reduction in overall burden on consumer. Transaction New System Old System Comments Sale within the state SGST CGST VAT & Excise/ST Under the new system, a transaction of sale within the state shall have two taxes, SGST- which goes to the state and CGST which goes to the Centre. Sale outside the state IGST CST& Excise/ST Under the new system, a transaction of sale from one state to another shall have only one type of tax, the IGST-which goes to the Centre. However the state portion will be remitted to destination state from it later. What is proposed for India is not a single national tax but a set of 38 taxes — 29 states taxes (SGSTs), seven Union territories taxes, one central GST (CGST) and the integrated GST (IGST) on interstate supplies — all harmonized to look like a single tax. Major raging concerns of states remains over the apparent loss of revenue and loss of fiscal autonomy from the transition into GST regime. Major concern of states Post GST GST is a destination based taxation system, by which the IGST revenue on interstate sales (SGST portion) will accrue to the state which consumes the goods - destination based tax ('DBT'). Whereas in the existing scenario where CST is charged @2% (when form C is produced) or local vat rate (if C form not produced) is charged, it will accrue to the state which supplies the goods. Hence CST is origin based taxation as it accrues to the state which supplies it. Now, when this Origin Based Taxation is replaced by a DBT, then the manufacturing states is going to lose its portion of revenue from interstate sales and the consuming states are going to earn higher. Thus, state Govts. fear loss of revenue and expects compensation from the centre. Manufacturing states (Tamil Nadu, Gujarat etc.) loses and consuming states will gain due to this change. States with high and strong manufacturing base will be the biggest contenders for compensation Tamil Nadu government will lose Rs 3,500 Crores annually due to abolition of CST and wants compensation from the Centre. Maharashtra government is set to lose Rs 14,000 Crores that it collects as Octroi. The select committee of the Rajya Sabha addressing to the concern states. In its report submitted to the House, the committee has endorsed all the provisions of the Bill while recommending a liberal compensation package for possible revenue losses to the states for five years In the Bill, the Centre has proposed 100 per cent compensation for first three years, 75 per cent and 50 per cent for the next two years. However, the committee has recommended 100 per cent compensation for probable loss of revenue for five years. Central Government has agreed in GST Constitutional amendment Bill that 100% of the revenue loss would be provided by Central Government for a period of 5 years. Loss of federal autonomy According to the Constitution (122 amendment) Bill, 2014 — passed in the Lok Sabha last month, India will have not a single federal GST but a dual GST, levied and managed by different administrations. The Centre will administer the central GST and the States, the SGST. The monitoring of compliance will also be done independently at the two levels. Moving to a GST regime in federal setup will mark some curtailment of state's freedom. ""All goods and services will be divided into certain categories. The rates will be fixed by category, and a state, cannot shift a commodity from a lower to a higher rate, or put it in the exempt category. GST will mark erosion in the states' freedom to decide on taxes and tax rates. According to the Constitution, the States have complete autonomy over levy of sales taxes, which, on average, accounted for 80 per cent of their revenue. But with the GST, which mandates a uniform rate, even this limited autonomy would be gone. The task of designing GST is assigned to the GST Council, a collective forum of state and central government. Any change to tax rates will have to be within a narrow band prescribed by the GST Council. Any changes to the tax rate will need to be agreed to with three-fourth majority at the GST Council. While states together have weightage of two-third in any decision and Centre will retain the balance one-third. This is akin to giving the Centre veto power, which is biggest apprehension of the states. The council will be deciding on all important aspects of the tax, including the base, rates, allocation of tax base among the states, administrative architecture and compliance procedures This effectively means that states together will not be able to act on their own or take any decision, consent of the Centre will be necessary. Uncertainty clouds over major incentives offered by State government Tax incentives granted by state governments to companies making investments in the respective states. Some tax benefits are generally granted by states as subsidies based on the quantum of taxes paid (i.e. VAT and CST) by companies to the State Government on their manufacturing activities and that too, over a specified time period. Of course, such incentives are subject to a maximum ceiling limit based on total capital investments made by these companies. Since the amount of incentives are based on the amount of indirect taxes paid to the State Government, it is important to analyse how these incentives would get impacted under the GST scenario. Let us take a hypothetical example which would resemble many large investment units in Maharashtra. This hypothetical unit is promised that 100 % gross VAT/ CST paid by it will be refunded by the State Government as a subsidy for a period of 15 years (of course subject to the cap of total investments made). On its sale of, say, INR1000 crore per year it gets an incentive of INR 41 crore which is the tax paid by the unit on its 20% local sales and 80 % inter-state sales. Since CST is also paid to the Government of Maharashtra (being the originating State) that too is calculated towards the incentive. In GST, however, there would a two-fold impact on the quantum of incentives – one, inter-state sales would not contribute to the incentives under GST and two, the effective tax rate could also be lower. With respect to the tax on inter-state sales, since the tax would accrue to the destination state, the Government of Maharashtra is not likely to give any benefit. The benefits are thus limited to the 20% local sales which will bear say 9% SGST (assuming a GST rate of 18% divided equally between the Centre and the State). Today local sales attract a VAT of 12.5%. As a combined impact the hypothetical unit would get an incentive to the extent of INR18 crore per year – which is less than half of the INR 41 crore it received in pre-GST period. Shift in the power Currently the centre alone can tax 'services'. In GST it is proposed to delete entry 92C (""tax on services"") from List I so that the states as well as the centre can tax services. Also, both centre and states are to be explicitly empowered to levy goods and services tax, which is defined as a tax on the supply of goods or services or both. Thus the Constitution, upon amendment, will support levy of tax on services as well as goods by the states as well as the centre. States to retain power to levy tax on certain goods States have insistently demanded certain goods to be kept outside the ambit of Goods and services tax. Taxes on alcohol make up major chunks of state revenues — for instance, in Kerala it contributes 22 percent of revenue, while in Tamil Nadu it yields about Rs.21, 000 Crores per year. Transport fuels like petrol and diesel are taxed at 20 per cent, while states earn 35 percent of their sales tax revenues from them. Initially, most of the states were not in favour of keeping many commodities under GST. The main reason was that states enjoy autonomy in collecting state taxes and they were afraid of losing their rights. State governments wanted the Alcohol and Fuel to be kept out of GST system as these two commodities are the biggest contributor to their revenues. State government's 50% revenues come from petroleum products alone. Conclusion Implementation of GST by States would be most challenging job, especially keeping in view of losses that would be suffered by most of the states. Even in such a scenario more than 15 states passed the constitutional amendment bill in their state assemblies in a short span of 23 days against a target of 30 days. This is a commendable job which shows the spirit of cooperative federalism. I am of firm belief that in such testing times, India will come victorious and be better state.

About Site Languages Hindi Gujarati English Marathi Malayalam Bengali Punjabi Kannada Sindhi Tamil Telugu Urdu Useful Links Contact Search for: Menu Home Industry Featured Politics Consumers Download Videos Latest News Home / 2015 / Basics of GST – Implementation In India Basics of GST – Implementation In India Posted on April 14, 2015 by Admin in 2015 with 66 Comments Share this on WhatsApp Indirect Tax Structure in India India currently has a dual system of taxation of goods and services, which is quite different from dual GST. Taxes on goods are described as “VAT” at both Central and State level. It has adopted value added tax principle with input tax credit mechanism for taxation of goods and services, respectively, with limited cross-levy set-off. The present tax structure can best be described by the following chart: SHORTCOMINGS IN THE PRESENT STRUCTURE AND NEED OF GST Tax Cascading: The most significant contributing factor to tax cascading is the partial coverage by Central and State taxes. The exempt sectors are not allowed to claim any credit for the Cenvat or the Service Tax paid on their inputs. Levy of Excise Duty on manufacturing point : The CENVAT is levied on goods manufactured or produced in India. Limiting the tax to the point of manufacturing is a severe impediment to an efficient and neutral application of tax. Taxable event at manufacturing point itself forms a narrow base. For example, valuation as per excise valuation rules of a product, whose consumer price is Rs. 100/-, is, say, Rs. 70/-. In such a case, excise duty as per the present provisions is payable only on Rs.70/-, and not on Rs.100/-. Complexity in determining the nature of transaction – Sale vs. Service Inability of States to levy tax on services : With no powers to levy tax on incomes or the fastest growing components of consumer expenditures, the States have to rely almost exclusively on compliance improvements or rate increases for any buoyancy in their own-source revenues. Lack of Uniformity in Provisions and Rates Fixation of situs – Local Sale vs. Central Sale Interpretational Issues: whether an activity is sale or works contract; sale or service, is not free from doubt in many cases. Narrow Base Complexities in Administration GST ( Goods and Service Tax ) GST means Goods and Service Tax. It is an indirect tax levied on sale of goods and services. The reformists believe that GST is one of the most awaited law which upon introduced will boost the economic growth in the country. This law if passed by the parliament may come into force from April 2016. As everyone is talking about it now, let’s get into the basics of the proposed law in this article. Present system – This can be better explained through an example. Suppose you buy soap for Rs.50 per piece, it includes Excise Duty, VAT or CST, Customs duty on the imported raw materials, etc. So, currently you will have to pay multiple taxes on the same product. Let’s take another example; the food you buy at hotels will have VAT as well as Service Tax. Complexities in the present system – The taxes are levied by central government as well as state governments. So, the businessman has to maintain accounts which will comply with all the applicable laws. It is perceived to be a complex system. Hence, worldwide over 150 countries have adopted GST, a simple tax system. Though it is late, India is catching up with the global trends. Is it easy to implement in India? Not really. Today states have autonomy in collecting state taxes. They have the feeling of losing their rights! They want liquor, fuel to be out of GST tax system. They are also worried about Central government sharing GST revenue with the states. If India becomes one common market, then the states will have to share their powers of taxing with the union government. (Which means states can’t increase the taxes as and when, as much as they want) If the GST bill is passed ; will it come into effect immediately? NO. The earliest day we can see GST in India will be in April 2016 . Again implementation depends upon the initiative and involvement of state governments. Some of the states may act quickly and some of them may take time to implement. GST Rate- Today, one pays Excise Duty of 12%, VAT of 14% on goods (totaling to 26%). 12% service tax on services. So, the rates may be anywhere between 12% and 26%. The average worldwide GST rate is around 18%. FEATURES OF AN IDEAL GST The main features of GST are as under:- (a) GST is based on the principle of value added tax and either “input tax method” or “subtraction” method, with emphasis on voluntary compliance and accounts based system. (b) It is a comprehensive levy and collection on both goods and services at the same rate with benefit of input tax credit or subtraction of value of penultimate transaction value. (c) Minimum number of floor rates of tax, generally, not exceeding two rates. (d) No scope for levy of cess, re-sale tax, additional tax, special tax, turnover tax etc. (e) No scope for multiple levy of tax on goods and services, such as, sales tax, entry tax, octroi, entertainment tax, luxury tax, etc. (f) Zero rating of exports and inter State sales of goods and supply of services. (g) Taxing of capital goods and inputs whether goods or services relatable to manufacture at lower rate, so as to reduce inventory carrying cost and cost of production. (h) A common law and procedures throughout the country under a single administration. (i) GST is a destination based tax and levied at single point at the time of consumption of goods or services by the ultimate consumer. MODELS OF GST There are three prime models of GST: GST at Central (Union) Government Level only GST at State Government Level only GST at both, Union and State Government Levels EXPECTED MODEL OF GST IN INDIA- DUAL GST In India, the GST model will be “dual GST” having both Central and State GST component levied on the same base. All goods and services barring a few exceptions will be brought into the GST base. Importantly, there will be no distinction between goods and services for the purpose of the tax with common legislations applicable to both. For Example, if a product have levy at a base price of Rs. 100 and rate of CGST and SGST are 8% then in such case both CGST and SGST will be charged on Rs 100 i.e. CGST will be Rs 8 and SGST will be Rs.8. Interestingly, as per the recommendations of Joint Working Group (JWG) appointed by the Empowered Committee in May 2007, the GST in India may not have a dual VAT structure exactly but it will be a quadruple tax structure. It may have four components, namely – (a) a Central tax on goods extending up to the retail level; (b) a Central service tax; (c) a State-VAT on goods; and (d) a State-VAT on services. The significant features of Dual GST recommended in India, in conjunction with the recommendations by the JWG, are as under: 1. There will be Central GST to be administered by the Central Government and there will be State GST to be administered by State Governments. 2. Central GST will replace existing CENVAT and service tax and the State GST will replace State VAT. 3. Central GST may subsume following indirect taxes on supplies of goods and services: Central Excise Duties (CENVAT)· Additional excise duties including those levied under Additional Duties· of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957. Additional customs duties in the nature of countervailing duties, i.e.,· CVD, SAD and other domestic taxes imposed on imports to achieve a level playing field between domestic and imported goods which are currently classified as customs duties. Cesses levied by the Union viz., cess on rubber, tea, coffee etc.· Service Tax· Central Sales Tax – To be completely phased out· Surcharges levied by the Union viz., National Calamity Contingent Duty,· Education Cess, Special Additional Duties of Excise on Motor-Spirit and High Speed Diesel (HSD). 4. State GST may subsume following State taxes: Value Added Tax· Purchase Tax· State Excise Duty (except on liquor)· Entertainment Tax (unless it is levied by the local bodies)· Luxury Tax· Octroi Entry Tax in lieu of Octroi· Taxes on Lottery, Betting and Gambling· 5. The proposed GST will have two components – Central GST and State GST – the rates of which will be prescribed separately keeping in view the revenue considerations, total tax burden and the acceptability of the tax. 6. Taxable event in case of goods would be ‘sale’ instead of ‘manufacture’. 7. Exports will be zero rated and will be relieved of all embedded taxes and levies at both Central and State level. 8. The JWG has also proposed a list of exempted goods, which includes items, such as, life saving drugs, fertilizers, agricultural implements, books and several food items. 9. Certain components of petroleum, liquor and tobacco are likely to be outside the GST structure. Further, State Excise on liquor may also be kept outside the GST. 10. Taxes collected by Local Bodies would not get subsumed in the proposed GST system. As per the proposed GST regime, the input of Central GST can be utilized only for payment of CGST & the input of State GST can be utilized only for payment of SGST. Cross- Utilization of input of CGST in payment of SGST and vice-a- versa, will not be allowed. (Source:- Hindu Business Line, dated 30-06-2009) – Railways and Construction Sector might be included in GST – Liquor, Petro Sector, Taxes of Local Bodies might be out of GST – Stamp Duty – It has not yet been decided whether stamp duty will be part of the GST or not. * Sources of the above information – Back Ground Material Issued by ICAI on GST.

OR b) in above case, will the GST invoice be raised in Tamilnadu (by obtaining GST registration in Tamilnadu) , by levying IGST and will it be paid in Tamilnadu? If (b) is applicable, then does one need to obtain GST registration in each state, wherever the sale is made from Maharashtra, even if there is only transaction of inter- sale in a year in that state? Kindly clarify on this point. Thank you, Reply Jignesh Yagnik says: June 5, 2015 at 2:58 pm One word shall answer the question.: It is “Destination Based Tax”. This means goods produced in Maharashtra and Sold in Tamilnadu shall be charged in the state of Tamilnadu. As regards registration: Although, it is not very explicit but it seems that there shall be centralized or Group registration which shall be applicable to all states. Hence, tax generated from goods/service sold to “consumer” in the state of Tamilnadu shall reflect in Tamilnadu. Reply Mallikarjuna Gupta Bhogavalli says: April 21, 2015 at 4:15 pm In case of inter state sales, the tax is tracked through the IGST / CGST registration numbers of both the buyer and the seller. Ideally there should be only one registration number for a legal entity across the country and the same should be used for the CGST and IGST, this will ensure that, the thresholds are tracked correctly all transactions are under the tax preview. The seller will pay the tax to the central government, the way CST is paid today and there is a mechanism being proposed to transfer the tax from the selling state to the buying state. This is my view based on the information i have from the secondary media. Reply Anant Kumar says: May 19, 2015 at 2:00 pm Sir, why is the tax being transferred from the selling state to the buying state? Will this not result into cascading taxation? And who has to pay the tax in the end- The seller or The consumer? Reply Jignesh Yagnik says: June 5, 2015 at 3:06 pm Only one tax that shall cascade shall be OT – Origin Tax. You can take ITC (input tax credit) of IGST, CGST and SGST. However, more clarification is yet to come on offsetting capability of IGST, CGST and SGST on one to one, one to many or many to many. In case if any one is in to business of selling excise free goods was not able to take ITC on service tax paid. Now, Service Tax is subsumed in GST hence ITC is possible even on service purchased. So, such companies shall be benefitted. Reply Sunil says: April 23, 2015 at 12:06 pm Dear Sir, This webpage is really good and made simple to understand. My heartly appreciation for you Having Dual GST, Dual rate structure is again complicating the administrative work to everyone. What is it stopping the government (Other than revenue sharing threat of states) in implementing on law pan India with one rate. Also, why should Fuel, Liquor be excluded from this. By excluding these, again we are giving room to business men to do all unlawful practices… Even the revenue sharing can be addressed with a SLA being agreed between Central & State based on putting a rational basis in sharing the revenue. Thanks Sunil Reply RAJEEV HUZURBAZAR says: May 7, 2015 at 3:28 pm WE R MANUFACTURING SPICES, BABAY CERIALS. IS GST IS SINGLE POINT TAX OR MULTIPLT POINT TAX LIKE ALL CHAIN MEMBERS LIKE DISTRU]IBUTORS, RETAILERS, SUPERSTOCKIST HAVE TO PAY GST THEN TAX SUPPOSE 15% WILL BE 45 % IN ALL CHAIN HOLDERS, I.E WE HAVE BILL BY ADDING GST IN INVOICE. IF U HAVE HAVE ANY INVOICE PL GIVE EXAMPLE.PL INFORM .THANKS Reply Jignesh Yagnik says: June 5, 2015 at 3:25 pm It is definitely multi point tax but it is not cascading. Hence, 15% tax will not become 45% if it change hands from Company to Distributor to Retailer. Because, at each stage each channel member can take Input Tax Credit. Example.: If you buy Black Pepper @ Rs 60000 per qtl plus GST (15%) in Kochi, your purchase bill will have following components.: Basic Rate : 60000 SGST @ 7.5% : 4500 CGST @ 7.5% : 4500 Total : 69000 Now, if you sell the same to your distributor by adding 4000 Rs per qty margins in Kochi itself, it will look like: Basic Rate : 64000 SGST @ 7.5% : 4800 CGST @ 7.5% : 4800 Total : 73600 So, you shall be charged incremental SGST of 800 (4800-4000) and CGST of 800 (4800-4000) and now your distributor owns material @ 73600 (64000 + 9600) If your distributor keeps 5000 Rs margin and sells the same to retailer. His bill looks like.: Basic Rate : 69000 CGST : 5175 SGST : 5175 He shall be entitled for ITC on SGST @ Rs 375 (5175-4800) and CGST @ Rs. 375 (5175-4800). Hope this simplifies. In case of interstate sale or stock transfer, it shall follow IGST way. In this case also, IGST is fully entitled for Input Tax Credit. Reply Apurva Gujarathi says: June 10, 2015 at 12:19 pm We are excise registered dealer. We need to pass on the excise duty to our customers. Its bit difficult to maintain these records . Even to generate bill is bit tricky. For CGST the system will be the same or we can take input tax credit as VAT in Maharashtra. Reply Jignesh Yagnik says: June 25, 2015 at 11:41 am Simple: Excise will cease to exist and all taxes shall be subsumed in IGST, GST (CGST + SGST) and OT. Now, OT is not cenVATable. Except that.: 1. All output CGST shall first be adjusted by input CGST and input IGST in that sequence within that respective state. 2. All output SGST shall first be adjusted by input SGST and input IGST in that sequence within that respective state. 3. All output IGST shall fist be adjusted by input IGST, input CGST and input SGST in that sequence within that respective state. Hope this answers.

Reply pradeep jain says: August 16, 2015 at 10:01 am can you inform me what is the net rate government is targeting at? In simple words: I am a manufacturer . My input cost is Rs 116/- [Rs 100+16(GST)] My sale price is Rs 150/ . I collect totally Rs 174/ (150+24=174) from the buyer. I pay Rs 8 as GST (24-16=8). Therefore, net tax rate for me is 5.33% i.e. Rs 8 on a sale of Rs 150. My query is “what is this rate (net tax rate) the government is having in its mind? can anyone enlighten and guide mo on this? Thanks. Reply Jignesh Yagnik says: December 23, 2015 at 3:15 pm Just to give right perspective to your question: There is nothing like “My” net tax rate or “Your” net tax rate. If I consider the above example as it is, the government is eying at 16% of VAT rate. So, if I change your example at 100 Rs purchase rate and 200 Rs sale rate, “your” net tax shall work out to 8% (16/200). But this is not relevant. It is simple value addition and the “My” tax rate is only tax on value addition. If I alter example, where you sell 100 Rs. material as 100 Rs. The “My” Tax rate shall work out at 0% (0/100). But, it is not reality. It is 16% only which was collected at root level Reply ravinder kumar bansal says: August 18, 2015 at 11:18 pm From where we can get copy of Rules & Regulations & Act as designed upto date…..?

Reply Pankaj says: November 3, 2015 at 7:58 pm Hi, I have following questions: 1. can GST be also non-deductible i.e. no credit? If yes, then in what cases? 2. in the current environment, when goods leave the factory, an excise invoice is created. in GST environment what kind of document would be created? 3. as a receiver of goods from vendor, at present I book excise invoice at the time of goods receipt. what will happen under GST? Best regards Pankaj Reply Admin says: November 4, 2015 at 5:25 pm Dear Friend The below views are personal. 1. If gst comes on “no-set off” basis then the entire purpose of bringing gst will be defeated. But I am sure there will be intermediate ways to give small dealers a composition scheme as an option. 2. I am not an expert in excise, but government is trying to build a seamless platform for invoicing, which will be tracked thoroughly by the government. Eg: SAP is also there for building GST’s platform in India. 3. Managing of invoices will be more or less similar to VAT/CST structure as it seems more friendlier. Thanks for visiting my site !

Reply Vivek says: December 8, 2015 at 2:47 pm Hello Sir, Can you please confirm the impact of GST on : 1. Imports – Incase of Imports how GST will be charged. Currently when we import, we cannot offer the duty against Sales tax (like we do in normal purchases). So after implementation of GST what will be the scenario ? 2. VAT – Currently VAT on some products is 1%, 5% and 12.5%. So does it mean after GST is implemented, sellers paying VAT 1% or 5% or 12.5% will have to pay 18-20% GST ? What will be the effect to seller paying only 1% or 5% VAT or Sales Tax as per present system? Thanks for your guidance in advance. Reply Admin says: December 8, 2015 at 7:49 pm Hi 1. The basic criteria for bringing GST is to seamlessly make Input tax credit (ITC) available, including import duty. It should bring in a big advantage for importers when the actual GST law is made available. Also am sure many other tax experts visiting this site should feel free to comment on your concern. 2. Initially it seems the commodities which are charged at lower VAT rates will be charged at applicable GST rates, may be quiet higher than 1 or 5 %. But they shall also be eligible for any set-off (ITC) on purchases made across PAN-India, including the higher GST rates. So net-net the GST effect will start becoming fruit full in couple of years after implementation.

Pramod Madhav | Posted by Siddharth Tiwari Pramod.Madhav@aajtak.com Chennai, July 30, 2016 | UPDATED 16:01 IST A + A - Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa Highlights 1 For GST to sail through AIADMK plays a crucial role in the Upper House. 2 AIADMK asserted that until the remaining three issues they'll continue to oppose. 3 7 of the 10 issues are on the verge of being resolved. As the Goods and Services Tax Bill is likely to be tabled in Rajya Sabha next week, AIADMK plays a crucial role in the Upper House with its share of 13 members during the voting period. AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa has inadvertently opposed the bill as it will remove a huge amount of Own Tax Revenue from the biggest manufacturing State. Also with a large amount of tax spent on public welfare schemes, GST might hit very hard on the state's tax dependent public welfare schemes. OUR NEEDS ARE UNIQUE Earlier, Jayalalithaa has written many letters to the Prime Minister especially pointing out 10 points which don't seem to be in favor of Tamil Nadu. A major issue was the loss of revenue to the state which will surmount to 9,270 Cr per year. While 7 of these 10 issues are on the verge of being resolved, AIADMK spokesperson asserted that until the remaining three issues, including quantum of compensation for states, are covered Tamil Nadu government will continue to oppose the bill. ""Out of the 10 issue, there are still three key issues that remain to be resolved, as far as Tamil Nadu government is concerned. Tamil Nadu is a producing and exporting state. We produce 50 per cent more than what we consume. So our needs are unique,"" he said. Pandiarajan believes that out of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, the Tamil speaking state has the largest gap between production and consumption and feels that the game is kind of rigged against it. ""Almost 67,000 Cr is generated by commercial tax and large portion arrives from sales tax. What we had estimated before the manufacturing tax of 1 per cent got given up was that 9,270 Cr will be a perpetual loss per year,"" he adds. INDIA'S GAIN IS TAMIL NADU'S GAIN After a round of talks, the centre committed five year compensation to a firm. They arrived to the figure of compensation through a presentation in front of the empowered committee of ministers, 110,000 Cr was the ball point figure that should be payable to the central government and to the affected strong governments. However, AIADMK seems reluctant to agree to the model where parliament will decided how much compensation should be paid to a particular state. ""We can't be told a state 1/40th a size and 1/100th of economic contribution have the same weightage as us"", explained Pandiarajan as the second key issue. The third key issue, which Jayalalithaa has already addressed, was related to petroleum and tobacco products to be kept away from the GST net forever. ""We don't want this to be a transient phenomenon and within a year or two some other government comes in reverse it,"" says Pandiarajan, ""petroleum and tobacco products should be kept away from the preview before a constitutional amendment shall be passed,"" he adds. Pandiarajan asserted that GST in philosophy could create a one market state for products and raise competitor advantage and that's why Tamil Nadu government is engaging with the Center on GST issue still. ""What will be a gain for India should also be a gain for Tamil Nadu"", is what Pandiarajan believes and says that as these key points get resolved, AIADMK would take a favourable decision on the bill for the economy of India and Tamil Nadu.

But a report by global analyst firm Crisil says GST will benefit manufacturers as they will be able to save time and money in logistics. GST will reduce logistics costs of companies producing non-bulk goods by 20%, it says. With the introduction of GST, the central sales tax, octroi etc will be subsumed (form part of GST) and therefore the manufacturers will have to pay less to the government in taxes. It will also save time, the report said. Tamil Nadu government says it will lose Rs 3,500 crore annually due to abolition of CST and wants compensation from the Centre. Non-bulk goods constitute goods other than coal, iron ore, cement, steel, foodgrains, fertilisers and petroleum products. Tamil Nadu’s ruling party the AIADMK was one of the few parties which voted against the GST bill in Lok Sabha and has vowed to oppose it in the Rajya Sabha. “Manufacturers of non-bulk goods spend about 5-8% of sales on logistics. GST will save warehousing costs of 1-1.5% of sales in 3-4 years,” said senior director of Crisil research Prasad Koparkar. Forecasting more savings with the introduction of GST, Koparkar said “eliminating check-post delays will yield additional savings of 0.4-0.8%, thus taking overall savings to 1.5-2% of sales. But this will be gradual and back-ended as companies will have to realign supply chains while ensuring minimum business disruption”. But local lorry owners are not fully confident of reaping benefits from GST. “For trucks to derive full benefits of GST, petroleum and its associated products must form part of GST,” Tamil Nadu Lorry Owners Federation president K Nallathambi told TOI. “We fill diesel at a higher rate in some states due to the local taxes. If it is even across the country, it would benefit us,” he said.

15," All States Backs GST Bill Except Tamilnadu: Arun Jaitley - Vishwa Gujarat Englsih | DailyHunt news books English News >> VG News >> home Tuesday, 14 Jun, 12.00 pm A A A Home All States Backs GST Bill Except Tamilnadu: Arun Jaitley (14 Jun) Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday announced that all the states have expressed their support to back the GST bill, other than Tamil Nadu. A two-day meeting was held on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) consisting the Finance Ministers of all the states. ""All states have virtually supported GST. Only Tamil Nadu has expressed some reservations,"" Jaitley said. The GST Bill, though approved by the Lok Sabha, is held up in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling NDA does not have a majority. The Congress party, the original author of the tax reform, has said it would back the GST bill if the government agreed to cap the tax rate at 18 percent and create an independent mechanism to resolve disputes on revenue sharing between states. The proposed tax reform, India's biggest revenue shake-up since independence in 1947, seeks to replace a slew of federal and state levies, transforming a nation of 1.3 billion people into a common market. visit Vishwagujarat.com Dailyhunt Latest News Russian plane carrying 92 people crashes in Black Sea, Putin orders... 12 min ago India Chennai: Unable to bear work load, cop shoots himself after he was denied... 15 min ago Latest Footwear fiasco: Siddaramaiah's office denies... 23 min ago Latest MS Dhoni is like a father figure to me: Mohammed... 33 min ago National Government schemes have touched every household in Goa: Laxmikant... 33 min ago browse by topics Dangal Year End Celebrations Flashback & Predictions Demonetisation Digest view all topics Newspapers view all newspapers Blog FAQs News Books Business Work With Us Contact Us © 2015 DailyHunt Privacy Policy Top "
16," GST: Palatable for Industry, Sour for Fiscal-Federalism - Mainstream Weekly Mainstream Weekly About Mainstream Archives (2006 on) 2016 Home > 2016 > GST: Palatable for Industry, Sour for Fiscal-Federalism Mainstream, VOL LIV No 12 New Delhi March 12, 2016 GST: Palatable for Industry, Sour for Fiscal-Federalism Sunday 13 March 2016 by A.V. V. S. K. Rao “Taxes are the Sinews of the State.” —Cicero A Viewpoint So far in India, right from suppliers of raw materials, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and ultimately consumers—all are made to pay indirect taxes to the Centre and States. For instance, the manufacturer pays tax to the Central Government, on the supplies made to wholesalers in different States. Manufactures add the tax component to price and charge accordingly from wholesalers. Wholesalers repeat the same procedures when they sell it to retailers and lastly retailers by paying taxes to the government sell goods to consumers. The retail price includes taxes. Thus, it is leading to the compounding of taxes in the chain—that links manufactures and the ultimate consumers. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill intends to put an end to this system, simplifying by making the ultimate consumer or purchaser to pay tax. The 13th Finance Commission, headed by Vijay Kelker (2010), was entrusted with the task of facilitating the transition from the prevailing system of indirect taxation to the GST. When all taxes are abolished and in their place the GST is implemented, it is feared that revenue both at the Central as well as State level may go down. Any such loss in revenue would not only adversely affect the States’ finances directly as well as indirectly, as their share in Central revenues would also go down; for such an eventuality the Finance Commission has made a provision of Rs 50,000 crores.1 As a result of the proposed new tax system, big States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar with large populations where consumption is high (destination States) would derive huge tax revenue (GST). That is why these States are not opposing the GST Bill in its original form. As opposed to this, States where the production activity is based (origin States)—Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamilnadu—fear that more tax revenue would accrue to States which buy their products. However, the Union Government allayed their fears by way of compensation by working out a formula: the quantum of compensation to be paid to the States in case the revenue generated by GST falls short of what they have so far been earning through the existing tax system. In December, 2015 the Central Government cleared an amendment by which States will get full compensation for five years. Regarding the one per cent additional levy by the origin States (manufacturing States), the government adopted a more circumspect route, exempting stock transfers within group companies from the additional tax on inter-State supplies, but keeping the overall tax in place. On the whole the controversy on the GST Bill pinpointed the loopholes in the existing tax structure which leads to tax on tax in the chain of raw material supplies—manufacturer to final consumer. Multiple taxes imposed by different States and the Central Government not only increase product prices but also give enormous scope for tax evasion. Though India is endowed with a cheap labour force and the manufacturing capacity developed to produce a good variety of items for export purposes, multiple taxes at different stages prevent Indian companies from competing in the export market on account of the higher tax-induced prices. In addition, to avoid Central taxes on inter-State trade transaction, several leading companies have to maintain 25 to 30 warehouses/cold storages. In advanced countries, this number is between eight-to-10. For acquisition of land, for the construction of warehouses and creating storage facilities, each Indian manufacturer spends huge amounts. To move wares from one place to another destination there are many problems. Truck drivers, who are instrumental in the movement of goods across States on highways, have to cross 600-700 check-posts. By the end of 2014 the road transport sector supported the movement of 60 per cent of goods by paying 11 types of taxes to governments at different levels. It involves loss of time, money, and valuable fuel. Most importantly, the productivity and efficiency of drivers is on the declining side. In this context, it is argued, by reducing the number of warehouses the GST would help fast movement of goods thereby contributing to productivity in the economy. Taxes merging with GST Central Taxes • CENVAT • Services Tax • Central Excise • Additional Customs Duty (Counterveiling Customs Duty CVD) • Special Additional Customs Duty (SAD) • Central Surcharges, CESS State Taxes • State VAT • Sales Tax • Luxury Tax • Lottery and Betting Taxes • Taxes on Commercial Advertisement • Octroi What is GST? Since all the above taxes are merged in the GST, for all practical purposes it is considered as a major indirect tax. The GST, in principle, is the same as the Value-Added Tax (VAT) already adopted by all Indian States but with a wider base. While the VAT—which replaced the Sales Tax—was imposed only on goods, the GST will be a VAT on goods and services. In the present tax regime, States tax sale of goods but not services. The Centre taxes manufacturing and services but not wholesale/retail trade. In the proposed dispensation, the GST would comprise equal Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST), with no deviations from the rates/exemption limits, so as to clear away potential ‘rate wars’ between States. The Report of the Rajya Sabha Select Committee allows States the freedom to impose the SGST within a ‘band of rates’ in order to meet revenue expediencie or as a policy tool. Recent reports also contemplate a three-tier rate structure instead of two. The Centre will administer Central GST (CGST) and the States the SGST. Compliance will be monitored indepen-dently at the two levels. As per the provision in the Constitution, the Centre can impose taxes on production and services. States can levy taxes on sale of goods but not services. Similarly, the Central Government has no power to tax sales. States cannot tax imports. To empower the Centre to tax sales and States to levy service and import duties, an amendment to the Constitution is necessitated. Accordingly, the GST Bill, the Constitution (122 Amendment) Bill, 2014, was passed in the Lok Sabha in May 2014. The same is expected to be taken up by the Rajya Sabha in the current Budget session (2016). The main argument put forward in favour of the GST is that the GST, by encompassing an array of indirect taxes under one canopy, simplifies the tax administration, improves compliance and eliminates economic distortions in production, trade and consumption. In addition, by giving input credit for taxes paid on inputs at every stage of the supply chain and taxing only the final consumer, it avoids the ‘cascading’ of taxes, thereby cutting the production cost, and making exports more competitive.2 The producer gets input credit on taxes paid to raw material suppliers. He does not have to pay GST on exportable goods. However, he has to pay taxes on imports. The GST is expected promote exports from 3.2 to 6.3 per cent and imports from 2.4 per cent to 4.7 per cent. According to the Finance Ministry, these efficiencies generated by the GST are likely to add two per cent to the GDP. Consequently, revenues of the government would increase resulting in a cut in the current account deficit. In principle, the GST is designed to usher in a single national market. One of the major deviations from the GST is that sale of liquor, petroleum and tobacco products are excluded from purview of the GST. All over the world, nearly 160 countries moved to the GST-type structure. Right Rate The merger of many Central and States’ taxes, extension of input credit facility may result in the loss of a certain amount of revenue to both the Centre and States. To protect tax revenue hither-to accruing to the Centre and States, the issue of the GST rate arises. That rate is termed as the Revenue-Neutral Rate. The 13th Finance Commission’s Task Force on GST recommended 12 per cent—seven per cent State GST and five per cent Central GST. That was in 2010. In 2014, a panel of State Government representatives mooted Revenue-Neutral Rate (RNR) of 27 per cent (12.77 per cent CGST and 13.91 SGST). Revenue-Neutral Rate is the rate at which tax revenues for the Centre and States will remain the same as before the introduction of the GST. Both rates might be unrealistic. A 12 per cent GST will definitely mean substantial revenue loss for States, as the general VAT for many States is 13-14 per cent. In June 2015, the Centre hiked the service tax from 12.36 to 14 per cent, perhaps with an intention to move to a GST regime. On the other hand, 27 per cent GST would impose an enormous tax burden on the wage-earning classes. Any populist government would not dare to purchase unpopularity. The panel on the new tax regime, headed by Chief Economic adviser Arvind Subramaniam (December 2015), has suggested Revenue-Neutral Rate of GST around 15.0 per cent to 15.5 per cent which is much lower than the rates suggested by earlier committees. This is likely to be accepted by the governments (Centre and States). The capping of GST is not preposterous, it is in line with global standards, which is 16 per cent. In China the GST rate is 17 per cent, eight per cent in Japan and Australia 10 per cent. So 15-15.5 per cent is not unreasonable if India is to be globally competitive. Another aspect relating to the GST rate is that, as it is not mandatory, the clause relating to the GST rate need not be appended to Constitutional Amendment (2016). According to the GST Bill (actually Constitution 122nd Amendment Bill), 2014, passed in the Lok Sabha, India will have not a single federal GST but a dual GST, levied and managed by different administrations. The GST, even in the diluted version proposed in the GST Bill, can still accomplish revenue compliance, provided the tax base is widened making it identical for both the Centre and States. In other words, the GST like all indirect taxes is a tax on consumption; when there is uniformity of GST rates on all types of goods and services, it tightens the tax net in addition to widening it. Many countries that have moved to the GST regime have kept lower rates for select goods that include essential commodities. In some cases essential commodities are exempt from the GST purview. But the logic of GST is such that the economy is benefited when exemptions are minimum or near zero. Any deviation from the original framework of GST may gravitate towards fewer exemptions and higher rates.3 A Critique of GST The existing tax system has typically followed a model of rewarding States where production activity is based (origin States), as opposed to States where consumption is high (destination States). Accordingly, most States have incenti-vised the establishment of local industries in order to drive growth and augment tax collections.4 However, the present origin-base tax is anathema to the GST, which is by nature a destination-based consumption tax. While origin States may chalk out measures to redress the imbalance, the consumption and production patterns will not alter overnight, and industrialised States could be left in the lurch, at least in the immediate aftermath of the GST. Interestingly, there seems to be no globally available precedent which offers a solution to such an imbalance.5 With the move to introduce GST in India destination States, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Kerala, clearly stand to gain in terms of revenue, while origin States, such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, stand to lose. As per the GST Bill, all issues concerning rates, exemptions and the like are to be decided by the GST Council (of which the Centre and States are members) by consensus, which may prove elusive given the federal and revenue dynamics at play. Equally questionable is the voting pattern within the GST Council, with the Centre’s vote carrying a one-third weightage of the total votes cast, and the States’ votes a collective two-thirds weightage. In effect, each State, irrespective of size, representation and contribution to the GDP, will command an equal vote, a structure which works against the very basic spirit of representative democracy enshrined in the Constitution. Also, this type of voting system opens up the Council to greater manoeuvring by the Centre on issues that it seeks to pass or veto. According to the panel on the new tax regime, suggestions to impose a revenue-neutral rate of GST around 15 to 15.5 per cent would put the economy on a higher growth trajectory by encouraging production. But it should be noted that with the implementation of GST, although the export sector is exempted from the GST, most of the exemptions being granted to the small scale sector would be automatically withdrawn and worst hit by the implementation of GST would be particularly small enterprises, small traders etc.6 The GST is vital for the simplification of the tax system and will eliminate corruption to a large extent. There is dispute among States over the threshold level above which the goods and services tax (GST) should be applicable. It is ironical that the States are disputing whether the threshold should be Rs 25 lakhs or Rs 10 lakhs. The States supporting the Rs 25 lakh level say Rs 10 lakhs would put the small and medium industries and traders at the mercy of the Inspector Raj. There is merit in this. But those wanting the threshold at Rs 10 lakhs feel that it will add to their tax kitty. Perhaps the latter need to be convinced they will get enough revenue if the tax collection is efficient and transparent.7 The GST is to replace all other taxes, like sales tax, excise duty and VAT. This would enable the seller to bring down prices and pass on the benefit to the consumer. There is no reason why retailers and manufacturers would not want to pass on the benefits as it would increase their volumes. This, in turn, means more revenue for the government and eventually higher GDP growth. Estimates show that for the Indian economy, implementation of GST is expected to add between one-and-a-half to two per cent to the GDP growth, which is why it is important for retailers and manufacturers to pass on the benefits to the consumers. It is for the governments to see that this happens. Services, however, would be two to three per cent more expensive, according these estimates.8 The fine print will reveal which services would be exempt, etc. It is interesting that the panel of new tax regime (December 2015) has recommended 40 per cent tax on the so-called sin goods, like tobacco, aerated drinks and luxury goods. In the case of those services that enjoyed taxes between two to six per cent, the panel suggested a 12 per cent tax rate.9 Unlike the existing system, which has greater scope for manual intervention, the GST aims to achieve a singular digitised compliance set-up. The proposed GST will also be far more dependent on IT. The proposed IT infrastructure will have to be suitably equipped, as any snags would effectively render the levy dysfunctional. Till three decades ago, many economies followed the policy of higher corporate taxes and lower indirect taxes with many exemptions. However, faced with declining tax revenues and integration of world capital markets, many emerging countries in the world turned to indirect taxes. Fearing a further hike in corporate taxes might lead to capital flight, they started slashing corporate taxes. Besides, indirect taxes like VAT (now GST) have a wider base than direct tax and are more difficult to evade. The lower income groups spend a greater proportion of their income on items of essential consumption compared to the richer classes. Indirect taxes, which are regressive in nature, adversely affect their consumption basket, when all indirect taxes are merged in the GST. The BJP-led NDA Government seems to have diluted the ‘welfare’ ideal of the Indian mixed economy. The 2015-16 Budget fixed a roll-out date for the GST (April 2016). The Budget abolished the wealth tax. Though the corporate tax was kept 30 per cent, there was a promise to reduce it to 25 per cent in a phased manner by 2019-20. In the Budget there is an estimated Rs 20,000 crore exemptions and incentives per year to the corporate world, that is, a total of Rs 80,000 crore tax exemptions granted over a period of four years. There is a proposal to reduce direct taxes levied on the higher income groups to the tune of Rs 8315 crores. There’s a steep increase in indirect taxes that would cause a heavy burden on the lower and middle income groups to the extent of Rs 23,383 crores.10 According to a study (2013) by the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability, India’s direct taxes contribute only 37.7 per cent of the total tax revenue, whereas in other emerging markets, such as South Africa, direct taxes fetch 55.85 per cent and in Indonesia, 55.85 per cent. When the GST is adopted in the Indian federation, the taxation regime will become more regressive. Only time will tell whether the GST will have a positive impact on the GDP. But one thing the GST will not have: a positive impact on the States’ fiscal, and therefore fiscal-federalism. References 1.

A Business Today-BMR Advisors Report Last Updated: September 1, 2016 | 12:59 IST With the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) and the Lok Sabha (Lower House) unanimously passing the 122nd Constitution Amendment Bill (the 'Bill'), it appears that one of India's most significant tax reforms since independence - Goods and Service Tax (""GST'), is finally on its way to reality. After being approved by the Upper House of the Parliament unanimously with 203 votes, the amended Bill was also approved by the Lok Sabha with a whopping 443 votes. After a 13 year long hiatus since the tax was first mooted, the Bill has finally been passed in both the houses, with the democracy hailing the achievement as a great measure towards tax transformation and transparency. This milestone is expected to harmonise a mosaic of State and Central levies into a unified tax, creating a single seamless nationwide market, reducing business transaction costs, and catalysing the overall long term economic growth of the country. While both the houses has given their nod, the next step involves at least 50 percent of the States providing their ratification on the Bill. It is expected that at least half the States would ratify the Bill within the next 30 days, as the Central Government seeks to put its best foot forward to roll out the new tax system by April 1, 2017. Support from States In this regard, the Honourable Union Finance Minister - Mr Arun Jaitley has expressed that virtually all the States (except Tamil Nadu) have presently provided their in-principle support to the idea of GST in its present form. While Tamil Nadu has expressed concerns about revenue loss and has expressed need for a separate dispute-resolution body on GST, other States have opposed the same basis the view that concerns of revenue loss are applicable to them as well and that the GST Council proposed to be set up would handle dispute resolution. Key producing States such as Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Maharashtra and West Bengal have estimated revenue losses of about 4,000 to 5,000 Crores each. As a result, compensation to the States for such revenue loss is critical to seek support of the States; however, such compensation can only be fixed after the tax rate is finalised. Several states have advocated for a standard GST rate of about 22-24% to minimise revenue losses. This suggestion is way ahead of the 17-19% proposed by the Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian. Also, while the Centre and some of the States have vouched for a GST threshold of INR 25 Lakhs, certain States have been insisting on a threshold of INR 10 Lakhs to minimize revenue losses. Readiness of States for roll-out of GST In spite of the above inconsistencies, States have been gearing up to become GST ready by April 2017, the proposed deadline for roll-out of the much awaited tax reform. The Kerala State Government is gearing up to usher in GST through modernisation of the Commercial Taxes Department and imparting training to officials. Honourable Finance Minister - Mr TM Thomas Isaac said that the Taxes Department needed to be duly equipped for introducing GST, and has proposed to give intensive training for department personnel. Further, in their 2016-17 Budgets, key BJP ruled states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan as well as non-BJP ruled states like Bihar and Himachal Pradesh proposed amnesty schemes for cases related to value added tax, central sales tax and sales tax. Most of these amnesty schemes revolve around waiver of interest and penalty on payment of tax. West Bengal had also come out with an amnesty scheme for unregistered dealers to widen its tax base. The rationale behind introduction of such amnesty schemes is to reduce the backlog of pending cases before implementation of GST. Setting up of a robust IT infrastructure has been touted as one of the greatest challenges to be faced by the States, while implementing GST. In this regard, many States have made significant headway in putting in place the IT infrastructure for the expected transition to the GST regime. In Gujarat, the tax department has started cleaning up data related to PAN card holding dealers. Validated PAN would be required when States move to the GST network. Gujarat has validated around 489,000 PAN holders till date, say tax officials. ALSO READ : GST: Is India Inc ready? Maharashtra has currently initiated a training programme for training 100 master trainers in the State. These trainers are expected to further train about 5,000 officers and inspectors of the State sales tax department. Also, State tax officials have already vetted PAN card details of the 800,000 odd dealers located in the State. As per a senior official in West Bengal State's IT department, West Bengal has been working on integrating its IT software with the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN), the IT backbone connecting all State Governments, businesses, banks and other stakeholders on a real-time basis. Among southern states, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka already boast of a fairly robust IT-based tax infrastructure system. Once the GSTN software is ready, the States are expected to intensify efforts on training. Industry peek - Key sectors While the Centre and the States are on course aiding transition into the much awaited tax reform, the industry has also been upbeat on building a transparent tax administration. Growth of any business is good news for the economy and especially the taxman. GST is expected to increase the tax revenues through growing businesses across sectors and to support the businesses with a clarity on taxation matters and ease of doing business. Speaking of sectors, it is touted that the manufacturing sector, which has currently been plagued by a complex tax structure, inadequate infrastructure and bureaucracy, would gain the most. The new GST regime is expected to trigger a transformational shift from a complex multi-layered indirect taxation system to a unified indirect one. Some of the key gains expected in the sector are as follows: Opportunity to re-structure the supply chain as per commercial factors Reduced costs of production, on account of higher creditability of taxes Hassle free supply of goods, on account of reduction of stoppage time at check posts Long term estimated increase in higher outputs, increase in employment and economic boom Elimination of compliance requirements in relation to forms for stock transfers, branch transfers, inter-state supplies Other key sectors that are expected to gain from GST are as follows: FMCG Sector It is expected that companies in the FMCG sector could generate substantial savings in logistics and distribution costs, given that the need for reduction in warehouses and multiple sales depots. Currently, it is estimated that FMCG companies pay indirect taxes approximating to almost 24-25% including excise duty, VAT and entry tax. Given a GST of about 18%, this could yield significant reduction in taxes. However, in case the recommended 40% ""sin/ demerit"" rate of GST is made applicable for products such as aerated beverages and tobacco products, the prices of such products may increase substantially. Real Estate Sector GST is expected to be a huge game-changer for the real estate sector. This is primarily on account of the fact that presently, there is an overlap of VAT and service tax on a certain portion of works contracts ranging from 120 - 145% depending on the kind of contract and consequent disputes around this with both the Central and State authorities; this is expected to be addressed under GST. Also, while the excise duty paid on procurements like steel, cement and other materials used in construction becomes a cost in the system presently, GST paid on these materials should be available as credit, thereby reducing cost of construction. Further, CST, entry tax, octroi being subsumed into GST, the same will not be a cost anymore in the hands of the contractor. Hence, the contract prices should come down, which in turn should benefit the developers and more importantly buyers of real estate, ie, the common man. Also, the issue of different tax structures being followed by developers across States or within the same State, should be addressed under the GST regime, with the proposed uniform tax structure. This should ideally benefit the sector as a whole, reducing tax costs and complications. E-Commerce Sector It is expected that GST would help create a single unified market across India allowing seamless movement and supply of goods to every part of the country. It will also eliminate the cascading effect of taxes on customers which will bring efficiency in product costs. This is likely to benefit the e-commerce segment immensely given that their business model is dependent on connecting vendors and customers located across geographies. While the idea of GST is expected to benefit the sector, the proposed mechanism of collection of tax at source (TCS) is likely to increase working capital requirements and administration and documentation workload for ecommerce firms. Media Sector The media sector is currently plagued with service tax as well as entertainment tax. GST is expected to bring a major change in this regard, and uniformity in businesses. Taxes could go down on account of a uniform tax rate. Multiplex chains will save on revenues as there will be a more uniform tax, unlike the current high rate of entertainment tax levied by different States, possibly resulting in a lower average ticket price, increasing ticket collections. While the above sectors are expected to gain from GST, the Services sector is likely to be negatively impacted by GST on multiple counts. Some of the key factors in this regard have been captured below: Increase in tax rate on services under GST regime at (the expected rate of) 18 percent from the current levels of 15 percent (inclusive of SBC and KKC) Increase in compliances, ie requirement of separate registration in each State of operations. Multiple registrations against present benefit of centralised registration Increased compliance requirements such as segregated filing of returns in each State where registration is obtained Multiple points for payment of taxes against the single point under current regime Potential increase in the working capital; due to increase in tax rates On account of the above factors, it is expected that implementation of GST would negatively impact the services sector. Increase in the tax rate from 15 percent to (the expected rate of) 18 percent is likely to increase the cost of such services, notwithstanding better creditability of taxes. As a result, some of the sectors that could be adversely impacted under GST include Telecommunication, Tourism and Hospitality, Insurance, Banking and Financial Services. Nonetheless, as a whole, GST will be a game changer for the Indian economy as it would develop a common Indian market and reduce the cascading effect of tax on the cost of goods and services. Given that the Bill has been passed in both houses of the Indian Parliament, the target for roll-out of GST on April 1, 2017 appears to be well within reach. As a result, it is highly pertinent that the Government as well as the industry prepares itself on time to transition into GST. Companies must make sure that their key areas of impact must be identified, training sessions must be conducted for their staff, supply chain, customer contracts, and vendor relationships must be re-examined, cost pattern must be re-evaluated and a GST ready ERP system must be set-up. While the companies may face initial hiccups transitioning into a more complex tax mode, what is expected to follow is an era of industrial growth and overall economic development.

This issue has been an old time favorite in media and surprisingly has failed to generate much concern in public. GST was first identified by the NDA government in year 2000. An Empowered Committee led by Mr Asim Dasgupta was formed to design the GST model and the IT back-end requirements. Year 2006/7’s budget speech UPA’s finance minister Mr Chidambaram announced that GST will be implemented from 1 st April 2010 March 2011 the 115 th constitutional amendment bill was introduced in Lok Sabha . It was hand balled to the Standing Committee on finance who presented the bill to Lok Sabha in Aug-2013. BJP who took an initiative on GST while previous Congress and UPA governments were busy reaching new high in scams. But it was shown as, GST was a disputed by BJP when introduced by UPA in 2011 and now is being opposed by Congress therefore it is dangling in Rajya Sabha States like Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu feel that since Central Government has retained the power to tax, tobacco and tobacco products. States namely Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are objecting to omitting Entry 55. Under Entry 55, tax is levied by the local bodies on the advertisements through hoardings etc. In 2011 Haryana (Hooda), Assam (Gogoi), Maharashtra (Chauhan), Rajasthan (Gehlot), Tamil Nadu (Jayalalitha), Kerala (Chandy), West Bengal (Banerjee) and many other states who opposed GST were not ruled by BJP. GST will replace most state and central taxes like Service tax, Central excise duty, VAT, Sales tax, Luxury tax, State and central surcharges and many more. GST will help to purge the complexity, bureaucracy and confusing demarcations in current tax system. GST will abolish cascading of tax.

20,"Why did Narendra Modi opposed GST bill when he was CM? - Quora This page may be out of date. Save your draft before refreshing this page. Submit any pending changes before refreshing this page. Hide this message . Quora Sign In Tax Policy Narendra Modi Taxes Why did Narendra Modi opposed GST bill when he was CM? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 3 Answers Adithyan Sivaraman , Practical knowledge in Direct and Indirect taxes Written 16w ago The main reason behind opposition to GST from states like Tamilnadu and Gujarat is due to the loss of Own Tax Revenue. For example if you take Tamil Nadu, the Own tax revenue form 70 to 75% of state revenue and Value added taxes forms the major component. Now there are two types of sales tax levied by the state Value added tax on intra state sale of goods - i.e sale within state Central Sales tax on inter state sale of goods - i.e outside the state In both cases sales tax will be collected by the state government which adds to their revenue irrespective where the goods are consumed. Moreover for manufacturing states like Tamil Nadu revenue from taxes is very high Now lets come to Goods and Sales tax. In GST there are three types of levy CGST - levied by the Central Government SGST - levied by the State Government IGST - levied by Central government on inter-state sale of goods and transferred to state where goods are consumed Here the IGST which is Integrated Goods and Service tax is most imporant aspect for manufacturing states. In case of inter-state sales e.g. from Tamil Nadu to Karnataka, Central government collects tax from the Seller in Tamil Nadu and transfer the tax revenue to Karnataka state i.e. state where goods are consumed. Therefore for Tamil Nadu it will be loss of revenue whereas in VAT regime the revenue would have flown to the TN government It has been estimated that TN government will stand to lose 9200 Crores if GST is implemented. This revenue loss will add to the already mounting debts incurred by state government on various public welfare schemes and will force governement to borrow more or stop few public welfare schemes which will have have a great impact on ruling government In such a case the State governement may tend to increase the VAT on goods which are out of the ambit of GST, e.g Liquor, Petrol, Diesel, Natural Gas, Aviation Turbine Fuel GST has its own set of advantages and disadvantages for consumers, manufacturers, sellers, service providers and finally the government But it is unreal to expect a GST regime which is flawless 295 Views Related Questions More Answers Below Is it not a hypocrisy of Modi-Govt to celebrate for GST bill as they initially opposed this bill when UPA announced it? Why is TN Govt opposed to GST? Why is AIADMK opposing GST bill? Why are the Congress and other parties opposing the GST bill? What did Narendra Modi do until he became the CM of Gujarat? I believe a legend is being manufactured to embellish his rather uneventful life.... Virag Kachhiapatel , Designated Partner at HKVK Written 20w ago Under GST for sale between one state to another IGST will be applicable on which central government will bifurcate the revenue between two state. Since Gujarat is the leading manufacturing state so tax revenue on sale of goods by companies in Gujarat to out side Gujarat will be shared with state government of buyer. That is the reason why Narendra Modi had opposed GST and that’s why Tamilnadu CM Jaylalitha is opposing GST because Tamilnadu is also manufacturing state. Modi Government has provided assurance to all state to reimburse the loss for first five years of implementation of GST and hopefully it will be passed in Rajya Sabha today. 316 Views · View Upvotes Chirag , A Learner !

The views expressed in this article are the author’s personal views and do not represent the government’s views. The proposed Goods and Services Tax Bill will mean that states like Tamil Nadu, which have manufacturing industries, will lose out on own tax revenue collections. Instead of focussing only on indirect taxation reform, the centre must also consider sharing direct tax administration with states, which has been the practice in other federal arrangements internationally. There is finally light at the end of the tunnel for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill in India. Tamil Nadu, a state with a substantial manufacturing sector, kept raising its genuine apprehensions from the time the Value Added Tax (VAT) was introduced, emphasising the revenue impact of shifting the levy of sales tax from origin to point of consumption. The Goods and Services Tax Bill will, when enacted, have a similar effect. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh stood with Tamil Nadu at different points in time, while now Tamil Nadu remains the lone consistent dissenter. Political dynamics have been influencing the positions of state governments. Woes of Manufacturing States For states with manufacturing industries, sharing the unified indirect tax base with the union government via the destination-based GST, will mean an outflow of tax revenue along with goods and services produced there, to states that consume the goods and services. In this sense, GST provides no incentive for manufacturing states. The search for a revenue neutral rate (RNR) of GST may be relevant for central GST, as shifting the levy from one state to another is not going to disturb the cumulative collection of tax for the central government. But states cannot have a uniform RNR that will match their present own tax revenue trend, as manufacturing and consumption levels vary from state to state. At the same time the combined GST rate (central GST + state GST) should be fair, reasonable and not regressive. Therefore, the proposed RNR, that is, the standard rate of state GST is not going to neutralise the effects of GST on the revenue collection of all manufacturing states. The worries of the manufacturing states have not been addressed properly by the union government. The revenue loss compensation assured by the union government for a specific period is a rocket booster, but it is doubtful that the proposed GST vehicle would launch the manufacturing states in the revenue trajectory they are travelling in now, especially after the booster runs out. If there is a failure in this mission, with no independent powers of taxation, such states may be left in the lurch. The next major concern is that the GST distorts the basic structure of fiscal federalism provided in the Constitution. The proposed GST Council would become another institution for politicking rather than a rational think tank on indirect taxation. Lopsided Tax Reforms As the volume of business across the borders of the states and the nation keeps growing, the focus is more on the reforms in indirect taxation and there have been perceptible changes effected in the system of indirect tax levies in the form of Modified VAT (MODVAT) and Central VAT (CENVAT) in central excise, VAT in sales tax, allowing cross credit of CENVAT between goods and services, rationalisation of customs duties, reduction of the Central Sales Tax rate and now the GST. No such radical reforms were attempted in direct taxes, as it mainly concerns personal income tax of local entities. Direct taxes are solely in the realm of the union government, which has shown no intent in reforming direct tax systems. It was proposed that a Direct Tax Code (DTC) be introduced to unify and simplify the direct tax laws. The draft bill was released as early as August 2009. After much discussion on the bill, a revised bill was released in March 2014, including the draft General Anti Avoidance Rules. In the budget speech in February 2015, the finance minister explained that most of the provisions of the proposed DTC have already been integrated into existing tax law, and concluded that there was no merit in going ahead with the DTC. The proposed reform of direct tax systems was given a silent burial. Low Direct Tax Revenue Growth This dichotomy in approach to tax reforms has really not done well for the public finances of the nation. India's tax-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio is at 16.6% and is well below the emerging market economy and Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country averages of about 21% and 34%, respectively. The contribution of direct taxes to total tax revenue of the central government has fallen from 60.78% in 2009-10 to 51.05% in 2015-16 (provisional). The direct tax-to-GDP ratio declined from 6.30% in 2007-08 to 5.47% in 2015-16 (provisional). In the assessment year 2004-05, only 4.87 crore people, that is, about 4% of the population have filed income tax returns with 14 lakh individuals paying 80% of the country’s individual income tax. All these facts go to prove that there is a decline in the efficiency of income tax collections, whereas the compliance in indirect taxes is steadily increasing. No doubt, the sudden growth in service sector in the last decade has given momentum to indirect tax collections, but this growth should have been equally reflected in income tax collection, as more tax revenue from services is directly related to income. This opposite trend in direct and indirect tax collections has really hampered the overall tax-to-GDP ratio of the country. Regressive Indirect Taxes Indirect tax is more distributive and the GST would make the tax on goods and services completely a consumption tax. This consumption tax paid by the consumer on taxable goods and services is nothing but a ""spending tax"" or ""expenditure tax,"" similar to income tax. One key difference is that for a consumption tax, the tax base is expenditure, not income. Everyone who consumes goods and services cannot avoid paying indirect tax, as it is built into the price. However, a majority of the population—poor and lower-middle class—consume such goods and services daily and tend to pay more indirect tax than the middle class and the rich. People in higher income groups easily avoid paying their income tax dues. This imbalanced compliance between direct and indirect tax in India makes the indirect tax regressive in nature. Purpose of Tax Reform Certainly, taxation should not be a hindrance to business, but the objective of tax reform cannot be confined to the demands of business alone. Tax reform is an important aspect of public finance management, as taxation is used as an instrument of attaining certain social objectives, namely, redistribution of wealth and thereby reduction of inequalities. Taxation in a modern government is thus needed not merely to raise the revenue required to meet its ever-growing expenditure on administration and social services but also to reduce the inequalities of income and wealth. Therefore, partial tax reform to satisfy big business houses is not going to serve any purpose for the 30 crore poor people of this country living below the poverty line. Fiscal prudence demands a matching reform in direct taxes also along with the introduction of GST to achieve a fair, equitable, elastic and progressive tax regime. A comprehensive tax reform keeping in mind the revenue requirement of the governments to meet their social and welfare objectives as well fair distribution of income, and wealth can be the only meaningful tax reform in the public interest. Fragmentary tax reforms carried out only with business interests, ignoring the genuine concerns of state governments are likely to create major hiccups in the public finance management of the governments in the long run. Direct Tax Reform Income tax law in India continues to remain one of the most complicated tax laws. Complexity of the income tax law has no justification and it serves the bureaucracy alone. Such complications have only increased the cost of compliance for the assessees and cost of administration to the government. Direct taxes are only in the domain of the union government and if there is a political will, this law can also be simplified and rationalised without much difficulty. Since the consumption tax of GST is much nearer to income tax, assessees of income may be given a tax rebate of a certain percentage of GST paid by them on their consumption of taxable goods and services. This integration of GST with income tax would complete the chain of the audit trail and make the whole taxation system more self-enforcing. Stabilisation of the present income tax law cannot be the ground for shelving the idea of DTC. If the same logic is applied, the indirect laws of the Centre and States have also been well established and there may not be a need for GST. In June this year, while addressing tax officers in the first ever Rajasva Gyan Sangam, the prime minister sought to double the income tax base to 10 crore assessees. Taking a cue from this, there should be a serious attempt to review the efforts towards direct tax reforms either through the DTC or in any other manner, as we cannot remain silent spectators to large-scale tax evasion when the need for revenue is more than ever before. Share the Direct Tax Base with States GST is essentially a consumption or expenditure tax. Income and expenditure are related and there should be routine functional coordination between direct and indirect tax administrations. When both the centre and the states agree to share the indirect tax base, the direct tax base can also be shared between the two. This would widen the direct tax base and improve the level of compliance as income earners are monitored by both agencies with reference to their consumption of goods and services. In the European Union (EU), from where we have borrowed many components of GST, direct taxation remains the sole responsibility of member states. However, the EU has established some harmonised standards for company and personal taxation, and member countries have taken joint measures to prevent tax avoidance and double taxation. In Canada, another prominent federal nation where VAT has stabilised, both the federal and provincial governments impose income taxes on individuals. The federal government charges the bulk of income taxes, with the provinces charging a somewhat lower percentage, except in Quebec. Quebec administers its own personal income tax system. In the United States, the federal government, most states, and some local governments levy income tax. Following these international models, the Government of India also may share the direct tax base with willing states with due modifications to the devolution formula. This idea was mooted by the present Minister of Defence, Manohar Parrikar, when he was the Chief Minister of Goa in the beginning of 2014. Now a rethinking has to be made on this important matter by the union as well as state governments. Need for Public Interest in Tax Reform Despite high economic growth, India ranks 130 th in the Human Development Index of 2015, below Malaysia (62), Sri Lanka (73), Mexico (74), China (90), Egypt (108), Indonesia (110), Philippines (115), South Africa (116) and Namibia (126). It is said that we are going to gain additional GDP growth of 1% to 1.5% thanks to the proposed GST. Balanced growth in production as well as consumption could lead to sustainable growth. Without increasing the consumption power of a majority of the population, India cannot achieve sustainable economic growth. Therefore, tax reforms should not be aimed only at increasing production. Instead, the reforms should be aimed at augmenting revenue to assure alleviation of poverty and creating a more equitable society. Comments (-) Hide EPW looks forward to your comments.

23," GST bonding in Bengal, hard bargain by Jaya Follow Us: Today's Edition | Wednesday , June 15 , 2016 | In Today's Paper Front Page Nation Calcutta Bengal Foreign Business Sports Horse Racing t2 T2 Online Opinion SPONSORED Property NEW Cities & Regions Metro North Bengal Northeast Jharkhand Bihar Odisha Weekly Features Knowhow Mon Jobs Tue You Mon Salt Lake Fri 7days Sun Graphiti Sun Leisure Sudoku Sudoku New Crossword Jumble Gallery Archives Since 1 March, 1999 Press Releases Businesswire India NewsVoir PR Newswire Extras Travel The Telegraph About Us Advertise Feedback Contact Us Front Page > Story GST bonding in Bengal, hard bargain by Jaya Our Bureau June 14: The Narendra Modi government today said after a meeting in Calcutta that it had clinched a broad consensus among states on the goods and services tax (GST) bill, a contentious piece of legislation that aims to create a pan-Indian common market. Within hours, Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa struck in Delhi by handing the Prime Minister a memorandum that echoed the Congress's demand on the bill. ""Virtually every state has supported the idea of the GST,"" finance minister Arun Jaitley said today after a meeting of the empowered committee of state finance ministers that was being held in Calcutta for the first time since the idea was broached about a decade ago. The GST will subsume a range of indirect taxes currently levied by the Centre and the states. The consumption-based tax aims to provide a seamless mechanism for claiming input tax credits, thereby avoiding the cascading effect of a concertina of levies on goods and services at the retail level. But others have said the GST would wreck the federal character of the Constitution by forcing states to secede their right to independently levy taxes. The federal argument was today iterated by Jayalalithaa, who is known to drive a hard bargain. The briefing in Calcutta seemed to suggest that Tamil Nadu had toned down its opposition to the bill. ""Even though it has some reservations on the GST, one state (Tamil Nadu) has offered a few suggestions that have been noted. So effectively, every state has either supported or accepted the idea of the GST,"" Jaitley said. But the memorandum Jayalalithaa gave to the Prime Minister around 5pm said the GST council, which would spearhead the tax regime, ""impinges on the legislative sovereignty of both Parliament and the state legislatures and completely jeopardises the autonomy of the states in fiscal matters"". ""If at all a council is formed, the weightage of the vote of the central government should be reduced to one-fourth of the total votes cast and that of the states correspondingly increased to three-fourths. Further, the weightage of each state's vote should be in proportion to the representation of the state in the Rajya Sabha,"" she has suggested. Jayalalithaa appears to say that the Centre's vote should have a 25 per cent weightage and the states should have a 75 per cent weightage. This is exactly the Congress position. The Modi government wants 33.33 per cent weightage for the Centre and the rest for the states. Jayalalithaa's memorandum has said ""the decision-making rule and voting weightage in the proposed council are unacceptable. They give the Government of India an effective veto in the GST"". The memorandum said: ""The Centre should strive for a broad consensus on important issues like compensation period and methodology, revenue-neutral rates, floor rates with bands, commodities to be excluded from the GST, so that states concerns on loss of fiscal autonomy and permanent revenue loss are allayed."" The Congress has been insisting that a cap on the GST rate should be spelt out in the constitutional amendment, which would make it virtually impossible to modify the rate without the support of two-thirds of Parliament. Jaitley said today: ""There was a complete consensus on the fact that there should be no constitutional cap because contingencies might arise in the future. The GST council will fix the quantum of taxation."" Amit Mitra, the Bengal finance minister and the chairman of the empowered committee, added: ""Today's meeting marks a record attendance by state finance ministers. We will try to fix the next meeting sometime in the second week of July."" At their next meeting, the state finance ministers will seek greater clarity on the revenue neutral rate (RNR) for GST - a notional rate which, if applied universally on a range of goods and services, will entail no loss of revenue for either the Centre or the states. Last year, the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), a government-funded research institution, had fixed the revenue neutral rate at 26 per cent. Chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian submitted a report last December that brought down the RNR to a more acceptable level of 17 per cent. The GST will have two components: a Central GST (to be collected by the federal government) and state GST to be collected by the states. The state GST will be chargeable only when the supplier and recipient are both located within the state. The Subramanian panel had recommended a four-tier rate structure for GST with a standard rate fixed at 17 to 18 per cent. The standard rate will apply to the broadest range of goods and services. It also recommended a ""demerit"" rate of 40 per cent for tobacco and tobacco products, aerated drinks, paan masala and luxury cars. One big sticking point in today's discussions was over a proposed 1 per cent additional levy that the Modi government had proposed to compensate states like Gujarat and Maharashtra that house some of the country's largest manufacturing hubs for the loss of revenue. States like Tamil Nadu have hotly opposed the levy, arguing that it would only perpetuate the malaise of cascading taxes and inflate prices of goods in consuming states. Tamil Nadu has apparently suggested that the manufacturing states like Gujarat - which accounts for over 15 per cent of central sales tax collections in the country - could be permitted to retain 4 per cent of the Central GST. ""As far as the 1 per cent additional tax for a period of two years is concerned, I have already indicated that I am quite flexible on the issue,"" Jaitley said. The Modi government has already said that it is prepared to compensate states for any loss of revenue for a period of five years. Mitra said there would be dual control regime for the levy of GST under which states would collect the levy from all entities with an annual turnover threshold below Rs 1.5 crore. Above that level, the Centre will collect the tax. The Modi government has put in the public domain a draft copy of its model GST legislation that it produces to introduce after the constitutional amendment bill is passed in the Rajya Sabha. The Congress has been insisting on an independent dispute resolution mechanism where the GST Council's prescriptions can be challenged. It had wanted a GST authority headed by a retired judge of a high court or the Supreme Court. Appeals against the GST authority's verdict could be made before the Supreme Court. However, the model GST legislation provides for a national appellate tribunal and appellate tribunals in every state. Decisions of the appellate tribunals can be challenged before the high courts and then the Supreme Court. But appellants will have to stump up 10 per cent of the disputed sum before they can file an appeal before the higher authorities which is designed to discourage frivolous cases.

24," Apart from Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, rainwater harvesting absent | india | Hindustan Times e-paper India Follow us: Today in New Delhi , India Dec 25, 2016-Sunday - °C New Delhi Humidity - Wind - select city Metro cities - Delhi Mumbai Chennai Kolkata Other cities - Noida Gurgaon Bengaluru Hyderabad Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Lucknow Patna Ranchi Powered by Close india world cities opinion sports entertainment lifestyle tech photos videos Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Mycollegesabroad Desimartini Apart from Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, rainwater harvesting absent india Updated: Apr 28, 2016 12:19 IST HT Correspondents Hindustan Times In this April 12, 2016 photo, a woman carries water from a spring at Raichi Wadi village, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north-east of Mumbai, India. (AP Photo) As India suffers from drinking water crisis triggered by depleting ground water sources, a practical solution —rainwater harvesting — has remained mostly on paper in most states. In perennially parched Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, rain water harvesting was made mandatory in 2008. Six years down the line, the ground reality has not changed much in the absence of an effective monitoring mechanism. “Any application for sanction of building map has to be accompanied by a drawing showing provision for rooftop rainwater harvesting (RWH),” said chief town planner of Lucknow Development Authority JN Reddy. But, the reality is that once the building plan is approved, there is no effective check in place to ensure compliance. The state’s ground water department, which is responsible for carrying out mass awareness campaign in the regard, had just been allotted a shoestring budget of Rs 30 lakh in 2015-16. Of this too, the department has managed to spend just Rs 4.03 lakh by January 2016. In Maharashtra, while the Mumbai civic body had made it mandatory for all new constructions above 300 square metre to install rainwater harvesting system, just 1,848 buildings out of an estimated 5,000 new constructions adopted the technique. Similar is the story in one of the most planned cities in India -- Chandigarh. In 2008, RWH was made mandatory for houses of one kanal (around 506 square metre) and above, but nearly 40% of government buildings do not have the system. In neighbouring Himachal Pradesh, rain water harvesting was made mandatory in 2013 but it suffers from the same malaise of poor implementation. The silver lining is states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu where rain water harvesting was implemented in right earnest resulting in improvement in ground water situation. tags Rainwater harvesting in India Drought in India India's water crisis India's drought crisis Rainwater harvesting in Tamil Nadu more from india Rajiv Gandhi murder case: Key witness asks PM Modi to ensure free and fair probe Dec 25, 2016 12:53 IST Regulate use of plastic flags, banners during polls: NGT to environment ministry Dec 25, 2016 12:47 IST Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Coloumns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint New Delhi: The government’s proposal to allow manufacturing states to levy a 1% additional tax on supply of goods could undermine the ‘Make in India’ programme by encouraging imports rather than the inter-state movement of goods that the goods and services tax (GST) had been envisaged to facilitate, chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian has warned. At a press briefing on Tuesday, he also made out a strong case for an interest rate cut, given the visible improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. “GST is a destination-based tax. This (1% additional tax) is an origin-based tax. So it sits very uncomfortably with the fundamental principle of GST. Second, the irony would be that sort of a provision would favour international trade over intra-national trade because every time a product crosses the border, it would have to pay extra non-vatable tax,” he said. “Think about a product going to Gujarat from Tamil Nadu crossing four states, the product will embody additional tax of 4-5%. That might make it easier to import to Tamil Nadu from Bangkok or wherever. So in a sense it has the potential to undermine ‘Make In India’. So that’s why we need to look at this provision carefully. The period that we have gained to reexamine GST, some of these issues need to be looked at again.” Subramanian was providing an interim update on the economy on the occasion of the Narendra Modi government’s first anniversary. The additional 1% tax to the integrated GST, or IGST, was allowed to be imposed after producing states like Gujarat and Maharashtra argued that they will lose out to consuming states because of the destination-based nature of GST. IGST, or the sum of central GST and state GST, will be levied on inter-state movement of goods and will be collected by the centre and later distributed to states. Subramanian is known for his candid comments, which at times do not match with the public stand of the government. In an interview on 6 March after he presented his first Economic Survey, Subramanian justified the stand taken by his team backing foreign direct investment (FDI) in supermarkets. The ruling National Democratic Alliance is against this, although it hasn’t bothered to rewrite a 2012 policy of the previous government that allows 51% FDI in multi-brand retail. Click here for enlarge “My preference would be yes. But then, that’s a political call. But as a purely technical and economic analysis, I think in the context of identifying these bottlenecks (in the agricultural markets), it is a desirable way to proceed,” he said then. His stand on the GST was backed by Bipin Sapra , a tax partner at EY , an audit and consulting firm, who said the proposed 1% additional levy is an aberration and should be done away with because it does not conform with the design of the GST. “Since states will be compensated for five years, there is no need for additional compensation through 1% tax, even if it is for two years. It is possible that after two years, manufacturing states will try some arm-twisting to further extend it,” he added. Logjam on GST The government was forced to form a committee of parliamentarians to study the constitutional amendment bill to pave the way for GST on 12 May following a demand by opposition parties that command a majority in the Rajya Sabha. The bill has already been passed by Lok Sabha, where the government is in a majority. The NDA wants to pass the bill in the early part of Parliament’s monsoon session so that it can roll out the GST on 1 April 2016. The Rajya Sabha select committee is expected to submit its report on the last day of the first week of the monsoon session, which is likely to begin in July. After both Houses of Parliament pass the bill, at least half of India’s 29 states must ratify it, before sending it for the President’s assent. Following this, the centre will set up a GST council. Later, the centre and the states will have to pass separate bills so that the new tax regime takes effect. GST aims to unify various central and state taxes, including the excise duty, service tax and value-added tax to create a common market. The government introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha in December 2014, after claiming it had achieved a broad consensus with the states. The centre has promised to compensate states for five years to allay concerns that they may lose revenue once GST is rolled out. It then inserted the provision to allow manufacturing states to levy the additional 1% tax on supply of goods for two years. For now, GST will not apply to petroleum products. Making rupee competitive Subramanian said India should keep the rupee competitive if it wishes to succeed in the Make In India campaign, which is aimed at attracting foreign companies to manufacture in India for exports as well to sell in the domestic market. Citing China’s example, he said the country is buying dollars to build reserves and cutting its interest rates aggressively to make its currency more competitive and promote growth. “China is now cutting interest rates quite aggressively to respond to its growth slowdown and that’s going to make its currency more competitive... So we need to respond accordingly,” he said. Citing low inflation and a manageable fiscal deficit, Subramanian pitched for a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at its monetary policy review meeting next week. “Looking at the analysis of what is the inflation forecast, what is the fiscal consolidation, what is the international environment... and how monetary policy should respond, I think there is scope for monetary easing,” he said. RBI kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 7.5% on 7 April and said it would wait for banks to pass on interest rate cuts that had already been announced before further easing. Some of the biggest banks in India have pared their base rate marginally since then.

26," Centre lacks support of non-Congress states on GST: Gujarat minister | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Locality World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# demonetization Taimur Ali Khan Bigg Boss 10 Christmas 2016 Narendra Modi Home India Centre lacks support of non-Congress states on GST: Gujarat minister Shares 0 Sun, 20 Feb 2011-09:44pm , Vadodara , PTI Gujarat's minister of state for finance Saurabh Patel today said that it would be difficult for the UPA government to implement GST (Goods and Service Tax) without the support of non-Congress ruled states like Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh among others. The issue has not got resolved due to the UPA government's indecisiveness and its policy of ignoring financial interests of the states, Patel told PTI . Reacting to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement to electronic media on Thursday blaming Gujarat government for delay in the rollout of GST, Patel said the arrest of the state minister that Prime Minister talked about happened on July 25, 2010, but Gujarat government had suggested a well-thought out approach towards GST before that. He pointed out that at a meeting held on June 16, 2010 with Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi insisted upon a nation-wide IT network for successful implementation of GST. Mukherjee immediately accepted the suggestion and gave necessary direction to his secretary. Before this, Gujarat government had submitted an alternative model draft before central government and the empowered committee in the presence of secretaries of central government in January, 2010, Patel said. Patel said the Gujarat government is opposed to the GST draft as it would increase prices of many items used daily by common persons by 7% to 8% besides making service sector more expensive. Moreover, centre's announcement of reducing the threshold limit for small industries from Rs 1.50-cr to Rs 10-lakh would increase the tax load on the industrial units. Patel said the central government came up with first draft of GST on July 21, 2010 that gave the finance ministry even more powers than the state assembly and Parliament. Gujarat objected to it which was later joined by states like Tamil Nnadu and Uttar Pradesh. Patel demanded to publicise the letters that Tamil Nadu chief minister wrote to the central government and said that it will make clear that all the states are opposing the centre's policy. Patel also charged that the Central government announced the GST rates without discussing with the states. Centre only kept on talking about unanimous decision but never discussed with the states. It has not even listened to the suggestions of the empowered committee's chairman Asimdas Gupta, patel further alleged. He also pointed out that the taxation structure shaped by the central government for the GST would prove helpful only to the big industries .

27," For a free trade pact within India | Business Line Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Editorial Columns Letters Books Blogs For a free trade pact within India Ritesh Kumar Singh/Prachi Priya · print · T+ · T- Tweet Such a long journey: With imposts at each stage KK MUSTAFAH Let’s move beyond the problem of exports and transit to GST. This will reduce levies impacting inter-State goods movement India’s merchandise exports have fallen over the last 16 months. Future prospects look bleak as ever due to sluggish global demand accentuated by a slowing China, and India being blocked out of regional trade deals such as TPP. On the other hand, despite all policy attempts, corporate investment has not picked up. That calls for urgent internal actions to sustain growth momentum. One such action could be tapping indigenous sources of growth. Are we really doing that? It’s worth repeating that India is a full-fledged member of WTO. It is negotiating a series of bilateral, regional and trans-regional free trade pacts with Asian, African, European and Latin American countries. However, trade within India is fraught with a series of impediments that inhibit seamless movement of merchandise across states and UTs. That limits India’s potential growth at a time when the global environment is not conducive to rising exports and protectionism is on the rise. It’s easier to bring in or move out merchandise from outside than from within the country. It won’t be wrong to say that India itself is not a free market area. India Inc. often complains of underdeveloped transport infrastructure and a complex tax regime that aids cascading of taxes. Over regulation of inter-State trade with frequent checks, stoppages and inspection at State borders often leads to delays in moving merchandise from one State to the others. These factors add to the cost of doing business in India (against the spirit of Make-in-India initiative) and escalate the final price of finished goods. That encourages imports from countries like China. What shackles India internally? A series of market distorting rules and regulations impede India’s evolution as a nationally integrated market. For instance, under the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) the government can declare any commodity as essential and impose stocking limits, creating uncertainty in the market. The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act mandates purchase and sale of agri commodities in government regulated local mandis only. That inhibits farmers from selling their produce in markets located outside their districts/States. Many of these challenges might be addressed if the NDA government’s flagship initiative of setting up of national agricultural market is efficiently implemented. Manufactured goods Multiplicity of taxes levied on manufactured goods in India has fragmented India into numerous State-level sub-markets. Despite VAT, the cascading effect of taxes persists. For instance, VAT charged by a State on sale of a product includes excise duty levied by Centre. Similarly, excise duty charged by the Centre on the raw material used in manufactured goods has already been charged with State VAT. Simply put excise duty is charged on the VAT element and vice versa. Further, Central Sales Tax (CST), a tax levied on the inter-state movement of goods, is not integrated with the VAT, making it ineligible for input tax credit. Moreover, variations in VAT and other tax rates across States lead to trade diversion, rate wars and a shift in manufacturing activities on non-economic principles. Entry and exit taxes Entry and exit taxes, and formalities required for inter-State movement of goods, add to manufacturers’ woes. For instance a Gujarati manufacturer who sources inputs from Maharashtra and then exports the finished good to Mumbai pays State and CENVAT, and a Central Sales Tax of 2 per cent on purchase of inputs from Maharashtra. Also, CST does not qualify for input tax credit for him. On entering Gujarat, inputs are subject to an entry tax. CST is again levied on the finished good “exported” to Maharashtra at the time of exit. On entering Mumbai an octroi is levied on the finished good. This makes the good “imported” into Maharashtra more expensive than locally (in Maharashtra) manufactured goods. Therefore, the manufacturer in Gujarat is discouraged from sourcing inputs from other States. To avoid this, the seller makes a stock transfer by setting up a warehouse in importing state (Maharashtra) and then makes a sale locally. In addition, manufacturer also has to pay service tax on transportation charges. This results in inefficiencies in supply chain impacting inter-State trade. The Arvind Subramanian committee report suggests that in six States namely Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, stock transfers, on average, account for as much of inter-state trade as the trade subject to the CST. Inter-state stock transfers in Andhra and Gujarat are more than double (2.65 and 2.14 times respectively) of their inter-state trade subject to CST, to avoid taxes. That is why even a 1 per cent CST for a limited period of time in order to compensate the States will dilute the essence of GST. Transport infrastructure India’s poor transport infrastructure also hampers seamless movement of merchandise within the country. World Economic Forum reports that “a truck carrying goods from Gurgaon to Mumbai has to pass through 36 checkpoints and takes up to 10 days. While 57 per cent of goods in India are transported by road, the most inefficient, expensive and emissions-intensive mode of transport, the figure in China is just 22 per cent”. Further, TCIL has noted that road-freight volumes are growing at a CAGR of 9.1 per cent while growth of road networks lags at 4 per cent. District and rural road network which accounts for 95 per cent of India’s total road network is fairly underdeveloped. State border check-posts further add to delays. The result is: Indian trucks cannot move beyond 20 km/h on average. Around 40 per cent of the time lost on road is due to stoppages at state border check posts, as per Ernst &Young. Inter-state regulatory requirements requiring detailed documentation like permits, waybills, forms, tax invoice, delivery notes leads to delays and increase in transaction cost. World Bank estimates that simply halving the delays due to road blocks, tolls and other stoppages could cut logistics costs by 30-40 per cent. India spends roughly 13 per cent of its GDP on logistics compared to 7-8 per cent in developed countries. The way forward Given the size and complementarities of its provincial economies, an early implementation of GST will create a pan-India common market of $2 trillion GDP and 1.2 billion people — a big attraction for any investor — and add as much as 1-2 per cent to GDP by creating a nationally integrated market. Yet, ruling and opposition parties are not able to reconcile their differences on GST. Singh is a former government official and currently a corporate economic advisor based in Mumbai. Prachi Priya is Asia economist for a top corporate house.

28," SKP GST Update - Issue 2 View archives | Subscribe 27 January 2015 | Issue 2 Reactions of the States and industry to CAB The Winter Session of the Indian Parliament 2014 witnessed the introduction of the 122 nd Constitutional Amendment Bill (CAB). The introduction of the CAB which proposes the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is the single biggest indirect tax reform in India post-independence. 122 nd CAB likely to be discussed in the Budget Session The 122 nd CAB, which was tabled in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament), proposes a wide range of changes in the structure of indirect tax in India. The Union Finance Minister, Mr Arun Jaitley, stated, ""We will formally take it (GST) up in the next session"". Thus, it appears that the CAB will be discussed in the upcoming Budget Session which will begin from 23 February 2015. GST will make India 'one common market' This notable reform though in its nascent stage, has received appreciation from leaders across the world. During the recently concluded Vibrant Gujarat Summit, World Bank President, Jim Yong Kim applauded the Government's drive to implement GST in India and said it would create ""one common market and substantial saving for companies on logistics, especially if the structure of the GST is uniform"". Union and States debate over GST It is apparent that the CAB is being actively discussed across all information circles, be it our day-to-day twitter to the global summits. The Centre and States have been under constant deliberations to reach a consensus on various issues and ensure a smooth transition into the GST regime. Concerns of the States Even though some of the States have their reservations regarding GST, none deny the economic benefits that will be derived from its implementation. States like Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and others have their reservations. Some of which are mentioned below: Gujarat has demanded that 1% additional tax (over and above GST) should continue until advised to the contrary by the States (instead of the timeline of two years as proposed in the 122 nd CAB). Tamil Nadu has opposed the introduction of the GST Bill without evolving a consensus on critical aspects like revenue neutral rates and bands, compensation methodology and thresholds. As Chhattisgarh Chief Minister, Mr Raman Singh rightly said, ""Almost all states have given their in-principle approval to GST. We are no different. We do not have any problem with GST. We want that, the government give us money on account of Central Sales Tax (CST) loss this financial year. "" Thus, it may be inferred that the aforesaid reservations of the States may not be a road block to the GST Bill, but rather terms of negotiation put forth by States to enter the GST regime. Centre's deliberations The Centre appears to be flexible about ensuring that the demands of every state are looked after. Mr Arun Jaitley has repeatedly assured that the demands of the States will be met and the implementation of GST may be expected by 1 April 2016. India Inc's reaction to the CAB The industry's reaction to GST seems extremely bullish. This could be due to the report from the National Council of Applied Economic Research, which said that the GST's rollout would, ceteris paribus, "" provide gains in India's GDP somewhere within a range of 0.9 to 1.7 percent. "". It appears that India Inc. is positive about: Less cascading of taxes Reduced production cost Single unified taxation system Less hassle of compliance Business organisations, after having weighed every aspect of the proposed GST Bill, are bullish. However they do express the following concerns: A steep rate of GST (approx. 27% by few news reports) may lead to disastrous results, negating every positive implication that GST could offer Inappropriate implementation of GST will lead to further confusion among organisations Phased implementation of GST also remains under a dark cloud, with a looming question, how will the credit allocation be made in such circumstances? If less time is given to the industry for implementation of GST, it could lead to chaos Since the introduction of the 122 nd CAB in the Winter Session of Parliament there have been much active discussions on the Bill, it will be interesting to see, how this Bill will be discussed in the Budget Session 2015. The industry is keenly watching how the Centre will deal with the issues arising from implementation and expectations of the business organisations while parallely addressing the needs of the States on GST.

Analysing the data between 2007-08 and 2014-15, the ASSOCHAM study on ‘Export Performance of States’ found that besides Gujarat and Maharashtra, the other top performing states on the export map include Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. While Gujarat and Maharashtra have been vying for the top spot, the latter became the best performing states shipping goods worth USD 72.83 billion in 2014-15. Gujarat had export shipments of USD 59.58 billion in the same period while Tamil Nadu emerged as the third largest sourcing state with USD 27.47 billion of the consignments, noted the study prepared by ASSOCHAM Economic Research Bureau. Though Gujarat and Maharashtra have traditionally been dominating the export business because of their locational advantage in terms of coastline, their growth rate has not been as good as those of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana which are doing a lot of catching up despite being land-locked. Surely, on a low base as compared to the best performing states, but UP registered a growth of 18.3 per cent at a compound level in 2014-15 while it was 14.4 per cent for Haryana. For Gujarat the CAGR was eight per cent while for Maharashtra, the compounded growth was 7.2 per cent, of course on a high absolute base. “Land-locked states including Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have to focus on massive improvement in basic infrastructure like roads, rail and airports to cut the transaction cost to stay competitive in an otherwise choppy international market,” highlighted the ASSOCHAM study. It noted that the Special Export-processing Zones (SEZs) have played an important role in promoting exports from the better off states. “For instance, Gujarat has been highly successful in tapping the potential of SEZs within its jurisdiction. Another noteworthy aspect is that almost three-fourths of operational SEZs are located in six states – Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.” Cost and efficiency of the transport system is of paramount importance for the competitiveness and success of export-oriented businesses. States with coastline, seamless connectivity and port capacity with deep draft (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh) also happen to be the leading exporters. On the other hand, many states in the hinterland and in the North East find it difficult to enter export market because of poor logistics compounded by a weak trade facilitation. “Current indirect tax structure unmakes India, by fragmenting Indian markets along state lines. This has the collateral consequence of also undermining ‘Make in India,’ by favouring imports and disfavouring domestic production and exports. The GST would rectify it not by increasing protection but by eliminating the negative protection for imports,” the ASSOCHAM study concluded.

By India.com News Desk | Published: September 23, 2016 4:24 PM IST Email Comments Coimbatore bandh: Hindu Munani chief warns to 'turn Tamil Nadu into Gujarat' after its functionary gets hacked to death Coimbatore, September 23: After Hindu Munani functionary was killed on Thursday night, the chief of the organisation has called for Coimbatore bandh today and also blamed Karnataka State Intelligence officials for its failure to prevent a series of attack against the community. The state leader of Hindu Munani also warned that if such attacks continued then Tamil Nadu will become “another Gujarat”. On Friday Kadeswara C Subramaniam, the State President of Hindu Munani issued a statement listing a series of attacks on his cadre including three murders – C Sasikumar, Coimbatore unit PRO, who was hacked to death on Thursday night – and attacks including arson at Tirupur, Vellore, Dindigul and now Coimbatore. According to Subramaniam, the attacks have been frequently taking place against their community members and the intelligence failed to protect or arrest the attackers. He further claimed that if the government was good enough, the intelligence would too have been good. He further warned, “The government should ensure that such incidents should not happen in the future. Or else it will lead to a situation of Tamil Nadu becoming another Gujarat”. Murder of Sasikumar’s, a youth icon among Hindu Munani, triggered communal tensions in Coimbatore and many parts in the western region where the organisation called a city-wide bandh today. The activists ofMunanisena attacked government buses and auto-rickshaws and forced shopkeepers and traders to down their shutters. In one of the protests at Athupalam in Coimbatore, there were severe clashes due to which police officials were ordered to lathi-charge to disperse the crowd. The senior leaders of Hindu Munani have rushed to Coimbatore, cancelling the four-day State Administrative Council meeting that was to begin in Tirupur today.

The bandh was called by the organisation on September 13 after one of the garment unit owned by one of its functionaries was attacked. However, it was called off following talks with the city police and opposition from the political parties on Bakra Eid. But the organisation conducted a protest against the government in the city on September 18. The heat after Sasikumar’s murder was felt in the Tirupur, a neighbouring city of Coimbatore where most commercial establishments including garment units were closed on Friday. Schools and other institutions including colleges too have declared a holiday today. In Tirupur, private bus operators have stopped operating in the city. A few State-run buses continue to run with police protection.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy said passage of the bill facilitating the Goods and Services Tax (GST), being hailed as the biggest indirect taxation reform, will ""not benefit"" the economy significantly. ""I don't think GST is going to be a game-changer. If it comes, it is ok. If it doesn't come also it is ok,"" he said, speaking at the industry lobby Indian Merchant Chamber (IMC) here. ""GST...it is not big deal for the Indian economy. There is a feeling that it will simplify the tax system, I have no objection to it,"" he said. It can be noted that the industry has been pegging an increase of upto 2 percentage points in the GDP growth just by the passage of this legislation which is stuck for many years now under two Union governments. Swamy also noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had objected to the GST when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, and now the Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalitha is objecting to it. ""At one stage, when Mr Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister, he took objections and wrote a letter to the government,"" he said. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said earlier this week that most of the states barring Tamil Nadu have come on board on the long-pending Goods and Services Tax bill and expressed hope of pushing the legislation in the upcoming Monsoon Session.

36," New Data Indicates that Direct Tax Share in Economy is at Decade Low - The Wire About Work With Us Contact Us Politics Government Communalism Rights Law Economy Agriculture Digital Labour Science Health & Medicine Environment Energy Space Tech External Affairs Diplomacy South Asia World Society Gender Books Cities & Architecture Culture Media Religion Video Search for... ? Business New Data Indicates that Direct Tax Share in Economy is at Decade Low By Anuj Srivas on 29/04/2016 • 2 comments Share this: Print More Email Pocket Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, while having bigger economies, contribute substantially less in terms of direct tax collection when compared to Karnataka and Delhi. For the first time since 2000, the government has released income tax data. Credit: GotCredit/Flickr, CC BY 2.0 New Delhi: How effective has India’s push to widen the direct tax base and crack down on black money been? According to recently released data by the income tax department, there’s still a long way to go. The government, on April 29 released its first dump of income-tax data since 2000, which is when the India Income Tax Statistics publication was discontinued. This data transparency has been called for by a number of academics and think-tanks around the world, the most prominent of which is French economist Thomas Piketty. Piketty, who in his trip to India in January, publicly debated with Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian on the need for data transparency and the need to increase tax revenues. The greatest amount of detail in these documents is on direct tax collection – a combination of personal and corporate income collection – which doesn’t paint a very strong picture. For instance, while direct tax collection nearly doubled from 3.7 lakh crore rupees in 2009-10 to 7.4 lakh crore rupees in 2015-16, its share as a percentage of total taxes has dropped by 10 percentage points over the same time frame. Financial Year Corporate Tax Income Tax Other Direct Tax Total 2009-2010 244725 132833 505 378063 2010-2011 298688 146258 1049 445995 2011-2012 322816 170181 990 493987 2012-2013 356326 201840 823 558989 2013-2014 394678 242888 1030 638596 2014-2015 428925 265772 1095 695792 2015-2016 454419 286801 1075 742295 In 2009-10, direct taxes accounted for 61% of total taxes in 2009-10, which dropped to 56% in 2013-14. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assumed office, it has dropped a little further, with direct taxes accounting for 51% of total taxes last year. Source: Income Tax India In terms of a share of the economy, the direct tax GDP (gross domestic product) ratio has dropped from 6.3% in 2007-08 to a decade low of 5.47% in 2015-16. This isn’t overly terrible news though. The fiscal deficit is currently at a respectable 3.9% of GDP (gross domestic product); though there a number of people who doubt whether the fiscal target for 2016-17 can be achieved. However, more government revenue clearly needs to be found to make up for the neglect in social sector spending. Curious case of states The data released also shows how much each state has contributed in terms of direct taxes collection. The biggest contributors are Maharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. For the year 2014-15, Maharashtra brought in a whopping 2.77 lakh crore rupees in direct taxes – which is nearly 40% of all direct taxes collected in that year. Delhi is the second biggest contributor at 91, 247 crore rupees. While the industrial states of Tamil Nadu (44,732 crore rupees) and Gujarat (35,912 crore rupees) also place highly, they are beaten handsomely by Karnataka which is the third highest contributor of direct taxes at a significant 60,592 crore rupees. While Karnataka’s place reflects its strong minerals and automobile manufacturing presence, its contribution also speaks volumes to the strong continued growth of the information-technology industry and the currently booming start-up and e-commerce ecosystem. Another interesting fact to note here is that the residents of Gujarat – a highly industrialised state with an urbanisation rate of nearly 65% – appear to pay a lot less tax when compared to the popular perception the state enjoys. A glance at the table below shows that Tamil Nadu suffers from the problem. When The Wire compared the GDPs of the states and their direct tax contribution, it shows that while the GDPs of Delhi and Karnataka are substantially lower than that of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, they actually contribute much more when it comes to direct tax collection. The table below shows that Karnataka’s state GDP was 7.02 lakh crore rupees in 2014-15 and yet it contributed a little over 60,000 crore rupees in direct taxes. Gujarat’s state GDP, on the other hand, was recorded at 7.6 lakh crore rupees in 2014-15. It contributed only 35, 912 crore rupees in direct taxes in the same year though. State (2014-2015) State GDP (In Rs. Lakh Crore) Direct Taxes Collected (In Crore) Maharashtra 16.8 277720 Gujarat 7.66 35912 Tamil Nadu 9.76 44732 Karnataka 7.02 60595 Delhi 4.51 91247 Piketty’s search for inequality Researchers like Piketty who are eager to incorporate income-tax data as a means of studying inequality may be left slightly disappointed as the most recent data on the number of contributors within various income tax brackets appears to go back only to 2012-13 .

(PTI) New Delhi: The important Goods and Services Tax Bill is a step closer to reality, with all states except Tamil Nadu backing it unanimously, the Centre said on Tuesday. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley who met finance ministers of 22 states in Kolkata said the Centre has the support of nearly all of them. While Tamil Nadu has some reservations against the GST, all other states backed in unanimously, Jaitley said. ""Virtually all the states have supported the idea of GST today barring Tamil Nadu which has expressed some reservations. TN has offered a few suggestions which have been noted by the committee,"" Jaitley said. Hours after the announcement, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi and urged him to accept the amendments proposed by her government to the GST bill. She said the GST, in its proposed format, would affect the autonomy of the Tamil Nadu government. The GST Bill is the biggest tax reform in 10 years and the Narendra Modi government is desperate to pass it in Parliament over consecutive sessions. The government now hopes to have the Bill cleared by Rajya Sabha in the monsoon session of Parliament. It has already been passed by the Lok Sabha. GST which aims to bring the country under a unified tax regime was proposed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2006. Shedding light on Tuesday's meeting, Empowered Committee Chairman Amit Mitra said: ""This was a historic meeting. Never seen such a large attendance of state Finance Ministers earlier. There was absolute consensus on GST in the meeting. Concerns were on dual control and the solution was GST will be on above Rs 1.5 crore turnout,"" said Mitra. Another round of discussion with states will take place in the second week of July, Mitra added. The other issue discussed at the meet, attended by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and 22 other state finance ministers, was the revenue neutral rate (RNR). ""It will come up for discussion again in the next meeting to find out what is the optimal rate,"" Mitra said. While the panel of Chief Economic Advisor had suggested RNR of 17 per cent, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy put it at 26 per cent. The government had earlier targeted to roll out the nationwide single tax regime from April 1, 2016 but the Constitutional Amendment Bill on GST has been stuck in the Rajya Sabha due to opposition by the Congress party. On the contentious issue of the Constitutional cap on the GST rate, the Finance Minister said: ""There is a complete consensus on that, there should not be any such ceiling as exigencies may arise in future. Now it is left to the GST council."" On the issue of additional 1 per cent tax as demanded by the producing states, he said the Centre was flexible on the matter. As GST is a consumption-based tax, the producing states had been demanding this extra tax. Regarding the future roadmap, Jaitley said: ""We will try our best to bring the Constitutional amendment in the monsoon session of Parliament. Then the CGST and SGST legislations will be put in place.""

40," Gujarat Assembly ratifies GST Bill - The Financial Express Home India news Gujarat Assembly ratifies GST Bill Gujarat Assembly ratifies GST Bill The Gujarat Legislative Assembly ratified the Constitution Amendment Bill on Goods and Service Tax (GST) unopposed on the last day of monsoon session today in the absence of Congress MLAs who were suspended for creating ruckus before the Bill was tabled for discussion and voting. By: PTI | Ahmedabad | Published: August 23, 2016 6:44 PM The Bill has been ratified unopposed by Gujarat Assembly,” Speaker Ramanlal Vora announced in the House after the bill was passed by voice vote by BJP legislators in absence of their counterparts from Congress. (Reuters) The Gujarat Legislative Assembly ratified the Constitution Amendment Bill on Goods and Service Tax (GST) unopposed on the last day of monsoon session today in the absence of Congress MLAs who were suspended for creating ruckus before the Bill was tabled for discussion and voting. “The Bill has been ratified unopposed by Gujarat Assembly,” Speaker Ramanlal Vora announced in the House after the bill was passed by voice vote by BJP legislators in absence of their counterparts from Congress. Passed by Parliament recently, the bill needs to be ratified by at least 15 state legislatures before the President can notify the GST Council which will decide the new tax rate and other issues. The government has set April 1, 2017 as target for rolling out GST, considered as the biggest tax reform. Related Sikkim Assembly ratifies GST Bill After Assam and Bihar, Jharkhand ratifies GST Bill Gujarat Assembly to ratify GST bill this month 60% probability of GST bill passage in current session: Nomura While introducing the Bill, Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who handles the finance portfolio, said the Congress- led UPA government had failed to evolve consensus in various states to ensure passage of the legislation. He hailed Narendra Modi -led NDA government for achieving the uphill task of passing the long-pending legislation in Parliament. “The deliberations on this Bill were on for last 10 years. The previous UPA government tried hard to implement the bill, but failed. As soon as Modi government took over in 2014, he (Modi) and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley started fresh discussions with states to clear their doubts,” Patel said in his address on the GST Bill. “Within just two years, Modi government successfully created an atmosphere of trust by taking everyone into confidence, something which Congress-led UPA could not do. As a result, the GST Bill was passed in both Houses of Parliament unanimously, despite the fact the BJP lacks majority in Rajya Sabha,” said Patel. Earlier in the day, 50 Congress MLAs were evicted and suspended for a day from the Assembly after they staged a demonstration and disrupted the House proceedings over the Una Dalit flogging incident. Patel, who came prepared with explanations for questions which could have been asked by the Opposition during discussion, said, “If opposition MLAs were here, they would have asked me why BJP’s Gujarat government did not cooperate with UPA government on GST in the past. My answer is that the previous draft did not have a provision to compensate states for the losses it would incur due to new GST rates. We were only given oral assurance, nothing on paper.” “However, in this new Bill, there is a clear provision to compensate states for possible losses due to uniform tax structure. As per the Bill, the central government will bear the losses, if any, for five years. This was not there in the old Bill,” Patel said. “Earlier, Gujarat wanted to keep the tax revenues collected from petroleum exploration, refining and production of by-products. However, Centre did not agree with it, as they wanted to keep it with themselves,” he added. He said Gujarat is a petroleum hub having refineries of ONGC as well as private players and that 40 per cent of state’s tax income comes from that sector. “Modi government took into account our contention and announced that income from taxes on petroleum production and refining would remain with the states,” the minister added. Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have already ratified the GST bill. Please Wait while comments are loading...

43," GST: Unfolding of a New Era? - MarketExpress India-First-Global-Insights-Analysis -Sharing-Platform Money Business Tech People CleanTech Personal Finance MyLife Opinion | About us GST: Unfolding of a New Era? Sunakshi Jain , September 22, 2016, 0 Comments With the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the entire indirect tax system in India (excise, state-level VAT, service tax) is expected to evolve. Goods and Services Tax is a comprehensive indirect tax on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and services throughout India, to replace taxes levied by the Central and State governments. Goods and services tax would be levied and collected at each stage of sale or purchase of goods or services based on the input tax credit method. This method allows GST-registered businesses to claim tax credit to the value of GST they paid on the purchase of goods or services as part of their normal commercial activity. Taxable goods and services are not distinguished from one another and are taxed at a single rate in a supply chain till the goods or services reach the consumer. GST will subsume all the indirect taxes and will thus facilitate a seamless flow of credit, resolving the problem of double taxation and cascading effects of taxes. The list of central indirect taxes, which will be subsumed with the introduction of GST include- Central Excise Duty, Duties of Excise (medicinal and toilet preparations), Additional Duties of Excise (goods of special importance), Additional Duties of Excise (textiles and textile products), Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD), Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD), Service Tax and Cesses and surcharges in so far as they relate to supply of goods or services. The subsumed state indirect taxes include- State VAT, Central Sales Tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury Tax, Entry Tax (all forms), Entertainment Tax (not levied by local bodies), Taxes on advertisements, Taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling and State cesse and surcharges. GST in India will be dual-model based that is taxes will be levied both at the central level (CGST) and at state-level (SGST). The input tax credit of CGST would be available for discharging the CGST liability on the output at each stage. Similarly, the credit of SGST paid on inputs would be allowed for paying the SGST on output. No cross utilization of credit is permitted. Apart from levying CGST and SGST, in case of interstate transactions, the centre can also levy Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST). IGST is not a tax in addition to SGST and CGST, but instead it is only a mechanism to monitor the interstate trade of Goods and services and further to ensure that the ultimate SGST has gone to the consumer state. Also, GST will be a destination-based tax. This implies that all SGST collected will ordinarily accrue to the State where the consumer of the goods or services sold resides. The Constitution (122 nd Amendment) Bill, 2014, deals with the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the country. The Bill empowers the centre to impose an additional tax of up to 1%, on the interstate supply of goods for two years or more. This tax will accrue to states from where the supply originates. Alcoholic liquor for human consumption is exempt from GST. Initially, GST will not apply to petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel. The GST Council will decide when GST will be levied on them. The shift from Sales/Excise tax to VAT to GST: Numerical Explanation Central excise/CENVAT is the tax on production/manufacturer of goods. Sales Tax is the tax on the distribution of goods, also known as state level VAT. Service Tax is the tax on production and distribution of goods. These all lie under the category of indirect taxes. Under the current tax system, there is an effect of tax cascading. However, the tax cascading effect got eliminated under the VAT regime. This can be illustrated with the help of a numerical example explaining the bakery supply chain. Example of a Cake supply chain Comparison of Tax calculated under the previous tax system and under VAT at different stages in cake supply chain Here the sales/excise tax is considered 10% and VAT is also taken as 10%. The total tax under the sales/excise tax regime is almost 3 times of the total tax under VAT. This is clearly showing the problem of tax on tax (tax cascading) and due to this the cost of production increases. However, VAT is imposed on the value added only. This means that whatever value addition any person in the supply chain does, on that value addition, one has to pay tax to government. Under VAT, the cost of production decreases and the final cost to the consumer does not include the effect of tax on tax. Though in shifting from sales tax/excise tax regime to VAT, there is a loss of revenue to the government, but still the shift is favourable as the government faced the problem of huge tax evasion under the sales tax regime. The final shift is made to GST regime. GST means Goods and Service Tax is eliminating many indirect taxes like VAT, Central Excise duty, Sales Tax, Service Tax etc., but the tax calculation for GST will remain same as it was for VAT. Due to subsuming of the other taxes and combining all under one tax regime, GST will reduce the final cost of the product for the consumer and let businesses work smoothly. Implications of GST with respect to revenue sharing between Centre and States Implementation of GST will have widespread influence on the revenue collection, losses or gains accruing from taxes, Tax-GDP ratio both for centre and states and also on provision of compensation for the states. Depending on the level of economic activity being carried upon in any state and the level of development of the state, different proposed rates of GST will affect states differently. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Haryana and Pondicherry account for almost 79 per cent of the VAT base in the country. The states like Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra, which have a strong manufacturing base and low consumption, will suffer more if GST rates will be fixed somewhere around 18-20 percent. Among others like the low income states with low consumption level, the GST is being the destination based tax will not prove to be very significant for bulk revenue collection. It is also apprehended that as compared to state GST, centre GST will be higher and thus a larger part of the tax revenue will move to centre only, thus creating vertical imbalance in the country. In terms of autonomy, states will tend to lose their financial autonomy as there will be uniform GST rates across the country with no liberty to states to fix their own rates. With regard to the compensation of states in terms of revenue losses due to the introduction of a uniform tax, centre has provided a firm assurance that states will be compensated for a full five years for any loss of revenue from GST rollout. The amendment to 2014 Constitutional Bill also clarified that Central GST and the centre’s share of IGST will also get distributed between the centre and the states. Also, till now, all the revenue that has been collected by centre or states was getting accumulated in the consolidated fund of India or State Consolidated Funds. But with the introduction of GST, the revenues will not move to consolidated funds, as then the disbursal of funds to states will become difficult. The points discussed above in the article regarding implementation and implications of GST, hold a critical importance. It is imperative for everyone, including central and state governments, consumers, manufacturers and service providers to clearly understand the concept of GST and be readily prepared for its implementation with sufficient requisites. At first sight, it might be apprehended that on its implementation, GST will prove to be a “win-win” situation for all. It is business friendly, will generate investments in the country and thereby build a strong investor confidence in Indian businesses. Moreover, for government, the problems of tax cascading or tax evasion will also get resolved. But, on the other hand, given the socioeconomic structure of India and the income disparity among the Indian states, applying GST might prove to be a success in short term, but in a longer term it may make a poor, poorer and a rich, sailing smoothly. The basic reason behind this is that by considering a uniform tax rate for the country, GST is not taking account the widespread income inequality among the states. This might not be a very appropriate model for a growing economy like India. Thus the exact situation cannot be ascertained before its implementation.

""We are well prepared to implement GST on April 1, 2017 and as part of it the state government has started migration process for commercial taxpayers. As of now businesses registered till August 31, 2016 will migrate on GST platform while the rest can be migrated from January 2017,"" said Nitin Patel, deputy chief minister of Gujarat. The state government claimed that the trading community need not engage in any physical transaction for migration on GST platform. Once user login into the VAT portal, a popup window with one time login and password will appear and it will direct the user to the GST portal where the user can fill required fields and submit scanned documents. ""Union finance department has been providing technical guidance to the states and we are also providing guidance to the traders. Moreover, we will jointly work with various trade associations to assist small traders and businessmen for the migration. Commercial tax department has started special help desk for this purpose,"" said Patel. With provision of special incentives to industries being disabled after GST implementation, the state government may make special provisions to give incentives to the industries in the state budget. Moreover, it is also planning to rework existing policies for the same, Patel said, without divulging further details on the move. After implementation of GST, government will audit 5% of registered traders every year. Currently VAT department's audit ratio is 7%. To formalise division of work between state government and central government, the GST council will meet on November 20 in which finance ministers of all the states will be present.

AK-91 GST ,touted as the biggest tax reform, is likely to affect the federal structure of India as it talks about a Uniform taxation system. One of the biggest concern has been about the autonomy of states which is likely to be affected by GST. 1)Financial autonomy of states would be affected as states would no longer have the independence to introduce/modify taxes as per their wishes.Concurrency of GST council would be required. 2)The advantageous position enjoyed by certain producing states like(Gujarat.Maha, TN) would be eroded and thus the elbow room enjoyed by them earlier in framing state specific policies/schemes would be compromised. 3)The revenue loss would be compensated for 5 years only.If states fail to adapt even after 5 year then once again it would have to depend on Center for Financial aid/GranTs/Special category status etc. Will Lead to weakening of unit. 4)Only those states that are well prepared will be able to absorb advantages arising out of GST. Thus, regional disparity might increase as their is no mechanism that would help in trickling down form stronger to weaker state. 5)Since it is an indirect tax reform. Hence, poor and people in unorganised sector likely to be affected the most.States would no longer be able to keep them out of the ambit based on BPL/SECC criteria. 6)GST council to enjoy the supreme power.Smaller states will have lesser say.Also no prcedence available for any such platform would make things difficult. 7)Many political parties would no longer be able to frame policies after coming to power based on their political ideology (e. g Left has tilt towards socialism and against privatisation) 8)Since , in GST council the GoI would have a 33% weightage hence it would ultimately enjoy a veto power.Thus, chances of Union centralization. Thus, the need of the hour is careful consideration and progress to encourage cooperative federalism. Jaya Swatantra Nice answer but I think point1 and 2 can be clubbed ..

When you say smaller states have lesser say ( #6), doesn’t it contradict with the fact, that every states have one vote despite how big ( economically contributing ) they are? Ekta I have a doubt regarding the question. Will it really erode autonomy of states because PARLIAMENT law will not override STATE law. Further, GST council has Finance minister of all states.So all states have equal say and consensus is needed for implementation. Centre has been given exclusive power only for IGST and now too tax on inter state trade is levied or a bill for the purpose is introduced with the recommendation of the president(Cabinet and thus centre). Even Rajya sabha(representing interests of states) has passed it with huge majority. Am i misinterpreting GST ? Someone please help. Sonia mehra Goods and Services Tax, is India’s biggest tax reform since 1991 economic reforms. It will convert India into a unified market by replacing all indirect taxes with one tax. There are apprehensions that GST will erode state’s autonomy on taxation, however this is not factually correct. The GST has 3 components CGST levied by centre, SGST levied by state and IGST which will be levied by the centre on the interstate supply of goods and services, and imports. So the areas of state and centre are defined. The parliament and state legislatures will have concurrent powers to make laws on GST. The GST council will be the body which will recommend rate of tax, period of levy of additional tax, principles of supply and special provision to certain states etc. The GST council not only include Union Finance Minister and Union Minister of State for Revenue, but also State Finance Ministers. Hence GST is not weakening Federalism, on the contrary it is strengthening Cooperative Federalism. Dheeraj Good Points [email protected] Straightforward no is not good I think a civil servant must analysis both negative and positive points and them take pragmatic decision. Rest is good Ekta I agree with your views. You can also add that PARLIAMENT law will not override STATE law (concerning GST). Further, state will be compensated for their loss in first few years. ankit goyel 1. Not all the indirect taxes will be replaced by GST. Some are exempted like tax on electricity. 2. Indeed it will strengthen Cooperative Federalism but it will weaken Competitive Federalism. Now states won’t have any power to give tax holidays for attracting investment in their states. Sonia mehra As you have said in 1st point electricity, petroleum is not included. So they can give low cost electricity and energy to attract investment (although we are not sure how long these will be out of GST) Competitive federalism could be strengthened by focusing on infrastructure by state govts. Attracting investments through tax breaks is not sustainable it has to be through supply chain competence. ankit goyel In the first point I was trying to highlight that you shouldn’t use ‘all’ indirect taxes as some of them are exempted. There is no dearth of innovative ways to strengthen competitive federalism. However, GST is weaken one of them. Hence it should be reflected in the answer. Sonia mehra As you have said in 1st point electricity, petroleum is not included.

The vote of the Central Government shall have a weightage of one-third of the total votes cast, and ii. The votes of all the State Governments taken together shall have a weightage of two-thirds of the total votes cast in that meeting.. This is to protect the interests of each State and the Centre when the Council takes a decision and is in the spirit of co-operative federalism. Sonia mehra 3 components of gst, integrated gst is about interstate transaction I am presently unaware about voting composition, thank you for bringing up this point. I will search about it Thanks. SM Hy, I have verified the said 2 points you have raised. I am quoting word to word from Indianexpress dated 9th august. So you can be rest assured of the authenticity. 1. After GST bill is passed, three more laws- CGST,IGST and SGST will be drafted by the GST council. While the CGST and IGST will have to be passed by parliament, states will have to pass their SGST laws. 2. Every decision of the GST council should be passed by three-fourth majority. The states would have two-thirds voting rights in the GST council, while the centre would have one-third vote and hence both the centre and states have to agree to pass a decision. Thank you Vinit you can add that 1)states will have 2/3rd vote in gst council as opposed to centre’s 1/3rd vote. 2)increased revenue through gst, in medium to long term will expand state’s autonomy to spend on development projects kaiser By creating a uniform taxation, GST would erode centre’s autonomy apparently as the states would no longer be able to govern their own taxation system. Any change in taxation system or increase in rate of taxation would need concurrence of majority of all states in GST council. Hence, it is widely feared that weak states would not be able to dissent or be vocal in GST council , therefore they will be left behind. Again role of Finance minister would come into prominence, and it would become a coveted position because finance minister would be chairperson of GST council. Though all the state’s CM would be member of GST council, but still there role would not be as much vital as would have been without GST. Further, state with strong fiscal capacity and good economic states would have same representation and same vote in comparison to sate with poor fiscal capacity and narrow economic base. In this way state will lose their individual will and freedom and will have to submit to the will of GST council which will be centaral body. GST in this way will act like a centrepetal force- drawing all states to one centre. Inspite of so many defects GST is still desirabe to the nation and policymakers as evident by historic vote for implementation of GST bill by both the LS and the RS. Buddha please review ? GST is a destination based tax that can replace several indirect taxes under one tax regime. GST is argued to curb state autonomy is a debatable issue . concerns on loss of autonomy by states • Loss of autonomy by states to modify tax rates thus concern among states is the loss of fiscal autonomy. States will not be allowed to introduce any new tax at will, change the rate of tax or give exemptions to any class of goods or service provider. • Manufacturing and more industrialised states states like Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat fear big losses of revenues on movement of goods made in their states as VAT was origin based tax while GST is destination based tax. • Compensation for losses by state will only be supported for 5 years. • within the GST Council, the centre will get one-third share in voting rights. On the other hand, states’ collective share will be limited to two-third. However GST is also expected to promote cooperative federalism and reduce competitive federalism. • Well Defined areas of CGST, IGST and SGST to avoid conflict. • Both parliament and state house have power to make laws on taxation of goods and services • GST council to settle inter state or centre state disputes by consensus, which may prove elusive given the political, social and revenue dynamics at play. • Parliament’s law will not override state law. • Single vote given to every state irrespective of its size in GST council • states are free to levy VAT on sale of petroleum crude and products until any decision by GST council ias aspirant The GST Bill was passed unanimously by the parliament. It is totally flawed to say that it will erode the state autonomy. In fact it has mechanisms to ensure that we move towards the path of cooperative federalism. HOW? 1. Both the centre and the states will have the power to legislate on GST. Moreover the centre cannot override the states. Will boost the centre and states relations. 2. The GST Council (the dispute redressal authority) will have states finance ministers as their members. States have full chance of presenting their view point. 3. The Rajya Sabha (Council of states) passed this Bill unanimously signifies how well this bill goes for securing the federalism as well as strengthening it. This bill is a win-win situation for all provided it is supplemented with the right environment (political, legal and ) to function properly. HungryBee About States’ autonomy:we can say yes in somewhat 1.Lose of autonomy to levy of state list taxes 2.Lose of Fiscal policy as instrument of social welfare and vote bank. 3.After GST implementation,not having any say for any unilatural changes. 4.GST is based on uniform rate which make Some states in losser side eg.,Punjab and haryana(purchase tax),Maharastra(octroi tax )and TN(Input tax credit decision) But 1.States-tax base increase-add of manufacture and service tax. 2.Cetre-add of only sales tax 3.with respect to GST,state are benifit most. Implications of GST for India’s federalism: 1.One market will resolve political and economic issues. 2.Uniform rates 3.Remove Inter state barriers which accomplise onness. Gurpreet Singh review Gurpreet Singh review Gurpreet Singh review Gurpreet Singh Review Gurpreet Singh Review Gurpreet Singh Review Michelin The GST Act seeks to bring uniform regime in indirect taxation by subsuming several forms of taxes such as octroi, entry tax, sales tax, entertainment tax, etc. It is expected to pave way for stability in tax regime system and improve ease of doing business. At the same time, it is argued that, it could lead to erosion of states’ autonomy as: ? Several forms of taxation such as entry tax, octroi, etc. which were hitherto under the control of states will be merged with a single GST ? Since it is a destination tax, several manufacturing states like TN and Gujarat fear loss of revenue ? Given the limited autonomy of states to raise their revenue potential, it is believed that GST will further limit their fiscal autonomy Implications for India’s federalism ? Since GST has sub-components for states and the central government, fiscal powers of state is not constrained or eroded to the extent it is perceived ? Further, increased devolution under 14th FC suggestions and autonomy given to states wrt liquor and petroleum goods is in line with federal spirit ? The revenue-neutral-rate (RNR), that is, the rate at which ensures that revenue of the Centre and states is not affected has been reached after consensus among majority of the states In this context, GST is expected to be a game-changer. States need to capitalize through structural reforms in labour laws, land issues, etc. to be able to provide the incentives for investors and business. In other words, GST is set to give rise to competitive federalism.

There No doubt this new tax regime will have impact and redefine the centre state relationships. After GST the states will not have independent taxing powers. But they will have collective power with 2/3rd of the votes in the council. GST council will be one of the most powerful federal bodies in India. The GST shall have three components: CGST levied by centre, SGST levied by states, and in IGST centre has exclusive power to tax on inter-state supply of goods and services, and imports. Industrialised states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat fear big losses of revenue on interstate movement of goods because the Indirect taxes were origin based tax and GST is destination based tax. Compensation for losses by states will only be supported for 5 years only. In few cases the states autonomy is not affected like tax on alcohol commodities is still under the jurisdiction of the respective sates. Ajitha pls review Ajitha correct plz Chitresh Verma Good and services tax (GST) has been recently passed by Parliament of India. Objective of GST is comprehensive indirect tax reforms in the country. But the implementation of GST will affect the autonomy of states as centralized tax will be applied. 1) Federal structure of tax system is change centralized tax system with states participation in GST council. 2) Prosperous states like Maharashtra will have effect on their revenue. 3) Introduction of social welfare tax like Fat tax in Kerala will not be possible. 4) The states will become depend on the central government of tax revenue sharing. 5) GSL council will become apex body for tax reform in the country. Thus, the states have understood GST and evolve the mechanism to maintain their autonomy. They have to cooperative with central and other states in this goal. BATMAN Not Really. GST which is biggest indirect tax reform since independence, will subsume all indirect taxes on goods and services at various stages of value addition (from raw material to final product being sold) imposed by the Center and State(s) into a single tax, and will make indirect taxes uniform on nearly every good and service across all states in India (except Petroleum Product, Alcohol for human consumption which for the time being have been kept out of GST). GST will make the fundamental structural change in indirect taxes imposition by states (on subjects included in states list) by state taking sole decision on tax imposition on goods and services being sold in that state to voting by majority of states on deciding and imposing taxes to be imposed (along with rates and timeline). So, decision will shift from single state to council of states representing in the GST Council (along with the Center) Similarly, the states combined voting power is 2/3rd v/s 1/3rd voting power with the Central Gov and each decision taken by the GST council must be passed by min 3/4th majority. So, states have the larger combined voting power. So, their autonomy is not as such threatened, but consensus would prevail. Center with 33% voting power will have a veto on all decisions made by GST Council. But States will no longer be making sole decision on indirect taxes related matters but the same will be decided by the GST Council represented by the states and UTs. Since GST is a destination based tax, so consuming states will definitely benefit. Earlier the indirect tax structure benefited manufacturing/producing states. So, GST will bring a shift here. The Center will compensate for the revenue loss to states for the 1st 5 yrs post-GST implementation. But after 5yrs period if states face any revenue loss, the same might not be compensated which is a point of concern which in long run may impact state’s economy and ease of doing business especially in the manufacturing states. Uniforming the indirect taxes, though will make the prices uniform across Indian states/UTs, will significantly impact the State’s indirect tax collections and might bring down the ID tax collection down for manufacturing states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, TN etc which will impact spending on state specific and state sponsored social schemes on health, education, skill development, TPDS etc finally impacting the target segment of population. Though overall GST is a welcome move that will ultimately benefit the consumers and improve the ease of doing business in India by simplifying the indirect tax structure and removing the cascading effect at various stages, it will have adversarial impacts also in short and long run for the manufacturing states in particular and a robust safeguard mechanism for such states is required for both short and long term.

AIADMK member Sasikala Pushpa , in not so many words alleged that the party supremo, Jayalalithaa had slapped her. In a passionate outburst in the Parliament, Pushpa, without actually naming the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, implied that she had been forced to resign from the Rajya Sabha after the incident. Pushpa went on to claim there was a threat to her life and dignity, and asked the government for protection. I want to thank my leader, as she gave me this post. But if a leader can slap an MP….I need the government’s protection. They are compelling me to resign. Why should I resign? I want to serve my country. Pushpa said in Parliament Incidentally, she had earlier claimed on Saturday that she had slapped DMK MP Tiruchi Siva at the Delhi airport allegedly because he had been badmouthing her party and its leader.

GST Bill to Be Tabled in Parliament on Wed: Cong, BJP Demand Full Attendance With the Congress lending its approval and good wishes for the goods and services tax ( GST ) reform to be passed, the Bill has been scheduled to be tabled in Parliament on Wednesday. Both the BJP and Congress have issued whips, imploring their members to be present in the House when the Bill is tabled. To get Congress on board, the government last week paved way for changes in the Constitutional Amendment Bill, by abolishing the additional one percent tax by manufacturing states and compensating all states for any revenue loss in the first five years after GST is put into practice, among other things. The mood is in favour of its passage. We have discussed it with everybody and we hope to pass it with consensus. I can understand your curiosity to know (the details), but I can’t tell you more at this stage.

Anandiben Quits as Gujarat CM, Cong Says “Overdue”, AAP Claims Credit Gujarat’s first female Chief Minister announced her resignation in a Facebook post, ahead of the state elections in 2017. While Patel cited the unwritten convention in the party, which dictated that those attaining the age of 75 must quit, as a reason for her resignation, there have also been questions about her inability to check persistent attacks on Dalits in the state, which may have affected her decision. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal took her resignation to be a sign of BJP’s fear of AAP’s growing presence in the state. On Monday night, soon after Patel announced her resignation, Kejriwal tweeted something to that effect. ????? ?? ?? ???????? ?????? ???

After Missing AN-32, IAF to Install Underwater Locator Beacons in the Planes After failing to locate the AN-32 aircraft – which went missing on its way to Port Blair from Chennai, and took with it 29 people on board into the Bay of Bengal – the Indian Air Force is now going to install underwater locator beacons in the transport aircraft. The missing AN-32 in question, which had flown over the Bay of Bengal multiple times carrying military personnel and equipment, had emergency locator transmitters (ELT) or beacons installed when it was upgraded last September. The ELT may make a significant difference in locating a wreckage on land, in the sea however, it serves little purpose as its emergency radio frequencies or waves are unable to cut through water. As a result, the search for the missing AN-32 is proving to be less than fruitful as a significant component that could aid search parties is missing.

Hafiz Saeed Threatens Protests in Pak Against Rajnath Visit As Home Minister Rajnath Singh is slated to arrive in Pakistan on 3 August to attend a meeting of interior minister of SAARC nations, the Nawaz Sharif government was put in an awkward position as Jamaat-ud-Dawah chief Hafiz Saeed warned of protests against Singh’s visit. Rajnath Singh (Photo: Reuters) Despite the threats however, India said Singh would go ahead with the visit, even as chances of bilateral talks with his counterpart in Islamabad seem bleak. Accusing Singh of being responsible for the eviolence in Kashmir, Saeed threatened that JuD will organise protests and rallies across the nations if he went ahead with his visit. The government in Islamabad seems to be in a sticky spot as the call for protests and the JuD’s stand on the issue in general has garnered massive public support in Pakistan.

Bulandshahr Gangrape Victims’ Kin Threaten Suicide If Denied Justice The Bulandshahr gangrape of a mother and her minor daughter by highway robbers in Uttar Pradesh has caused a stir in the country. Amidst rumours of laxness, the family of three – the two victims, and the husband – have threatened to commit suicide if justice isn’t served in the next three months. My daughter and my wife are not in a position to speak. For 18 years we have lived in Noida and now we are not able to return to our homes because of the shame. I appeal to the Noida Police to deliver me justice. I give them an ultimatum of three months. Post that, we will commit suicide. The gang ambushed five members of the family on the Ghaziabad-Aligarh highway on Friday night, looting them, before dragging the teenage girl and her mother to a nearby field and raping them, the family said in its complaint.

VK Singh to Visit Riyadh to “Assess Ground Situation”, Help Laid-Off Indians With the growing crisis of Indian workers in Saudi Arabia who have been laid-off, Union Minister of State for external Affairs VK Singh will arrive in Riyadh to assess the severity of the situation on the ground, and for a possible evacuation of thousands, in an effort to ease the strife of the stranded Indian workers. MoS External Affairs VK Singh. (Photo: PTI) External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told the Rajya Sabha on Monday that she would be sending Singh to Saudi Arabia. She also announced the government’s decision to provide free ration to over 2500 workers of the Saudi Oger company who are currently left in the lurch in some Jeddah camps. If any Indian worker abroad is unemployed, he will not sleep hungry. The government takes full responsibility to feed them. If they get another job, that is fine, but if they want to return home, then I assure you we will bring them home. Sushma Swaraj, External Affairs Minister According to sources among the Indians stranded in Saudi are 3,172 workers in Riyadh who were being provided for at their work camps, but had not received their salaries for several months.

Supreme Court Rejects Plea to Re-Open Amit Shah’s Case The Supreme Court on Monday quashed a plea by activist Harsh Mander challenging the exoneration of BJP president Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case. Responding to the plea, the court, said that there were serious questions over Mander’s locus standi (legal right to interfere), while also stating a that a person cannot be “interminably prosecuted”. Do you realise the impact of allowing you to intervene? There are certain rights a person has under the criminal law. A person cannot be interminably prosecuted by allowing one proceeding after another against him Supreme Court bench of Justice SA Bobde and Justice Ashok Bhushan In December 2014, the special CBI court in Mumbai had discharged Shah in the case. In its discharge order, the court had said that the BJP chief was “apparently shown to be involved in this case by the CBI for political reasons”.

Rajnath Singh to Get “Presidential” Security in Pakistan Security officials speaking to The Indian Express have revealed that Rajnath Singh’s much anticipated visit to Islamabad to attend the SAARC Home Ministers meeting is on track after the Pakistan government decided to give “presidential-level security” – its highest security – to Home Minister Rajnath Singh when he visits Islamabad to attend the SAARC home ministers’ meeting on August 3-4. Earlier, Lashkar-e-Taiba chief, Hafiz Saeed had raised serious concerns about the security of India’s Home Minister after he threatened to ban Mr. Singh’s from entering Islamabad. The “presidential-level security” will see about 200 personnel, including commandos from Pakistan’s elite special forces deployed to protect Singh. The report adds that the decision was taken at the high-level meeting chaired by PM Nawaz Sharif to discuss security arrangements.
