Economics Far From Silver Bullet, GST Will Likely Have Negative Impact on Growth By Rajul Awasthi on 25/07/2016 • 4 comments Share this: Print More Email Pocket In its current form, the GST will have a negligible positive impact on growth, may be negative for the business environment, and may not even be revenue neutral. GST: Silver Bullet or Flawed Tax Reform? Credit: Reuters There is renewed optimism about the passage of the Constitution (122 nd Amendment) Bill, known popularly as “the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill” in the Rajya Sabha and hence Parliament. In fact, the stock markets have consistently been reacting positively to any news of a possible rapprochement between the BJP-led Central Government and the opposition, in particular the Congress Party which has remained obdurate. While I agree that the passage of this bill would be an important step in the direction of tax reforms in India, I have strong reservations about the statements that have been made by industry leaders and even the finance minister, claiming this would be some sort of a silver bullet. GST, it is said, will lead to an increase in GDP growth rates by “one to two percent”, “create a true common market in India”, and build a better business environment, while being revenue neutral. My contention is that in its current form, the GST will have a negligible positive impact on growth, may be negative for the business environment, and may not even be revenue neutral. The original concept of the GST was to have a single tax which would subsume all central and state indirect taxes and eliminate cascading of taxes. The proposed tax does subsume the major indirect taxes, including, central excise duty, service tax, state VAT, countervailing duty / Special Additional Duty of Customs, octroi and entry tax, purchase tax, luxury tax, taxes on lottery, betting and gambling, etc. However, four critical state level taxes have been excluded from GST: tax on petroleum products, electricity duties, excise duty on alcohol, and stamp duty on immoveable property. Moreover, the “additional tax (not exceeding 1 percent) on supply of goods in the course of inter-state trade” simply Far From Silver Bullet, GST Will Likely Have Negative Impact on Growthappears to be a replacement of the Central Sales Tax since it is non-VAT-able. An ideal GST, with a low, single rate on all goods and services and a very small list of exemptions, is widely considered to be pro-growth as it effectively cuts out cascading of taxes and increases productivity of economic activity. Such a GST is the New Zealand model , introduced way back in 1986 with a standard rate of 10 percent widely applicable on all goods and services, the only exemptions being financial services, residential accommodation rent, and supply of fine metals. The impact of such a neutral GST was very positive; the GDP growth rate in 1987 over 1986 went up to 2.1 percent compared to 0.8 percent in 1986. Of course, at the same time, there was also a one-time jump in inflation (CPI): for the October-December quarter of 1986 during which GST was introduced, the CPI rate was over 18 percent, whereas it had been 11 percent in the July-September quarter. Canada versus New Zealand Canada introduced a GST in 1991. Several analysts have shown how this GST was far less than ideal, riddled as it was with several exemptions: various types of health, medical, and dental services, child-care services, legal aid services, educational services, services provided by financial institutions and investment dealers, insurance policies and the related services of insurance agents, residential rents, sales of used residential properties, and sales of vacant land and farmland, and small traders are also exempt from GST unless they choose to register. Now, if we look at the impact on the economy of the introduction of this tax, it tells a very different story. GDP growth rate dropped from 2.4 percent in 1989 to 2.1 percent in 1991 (note that the GST was introduced on January 1, 1991). Of course, there are bound to be a large number of other macroeconomic factors that would have impacted the GDP growth number, but this analysis does show a contrast with New Zealand. Given that in India, the proposed GST is also riddled with a very large number of exempt goods and a non-cascading tax structure will not be achieved, it is likely to have a negative impact on growth. Petroleum products constitute between a quarter and a half of states’ total revenues, and are hence significant revenue handles. Petroleum products are also a significant cost of production for several services and industries. Keeping them in GST would enable a producer to claim the GST paid on petroleum products as an input tax and create a smooth, non-cascading tax channel that eliminates the tax-on-tax nature of indirect taxation. This would prevent unnecessary cost inflation. Similar is the case of electricity duty. Allowing electricity duty to be subsumed in GST would provide producers to claim input taxes on electricity against their GST payments and prevent cascading of taxes. For petroleum products, enabling provisions have been created, which is a good thing, but levy of GST is to be made effective at a future date, and the date will be decided by the GST council, which has a 2/3 rd vote reserved for states. More on the GST council later. In the case of alcohol, it is very hard to understand the logic of keeping it out of the GST. It would be much simpler to administer for state tax authorities and to comply with for sellers of alcoholic beverages, if alcohol is in the GST. If a state wanted to levy an additional excise on alcohol, to raise revenue, or for making it more expensive in a bid to reduce consumption, it could still do it under the GST structure. Stamp duties are another significant source of revenue for states. In Maharashtra, for example, they are as much as 20 per cent of the state’s own revenues, and in Bihar, 12 per cent, according to the Economic Surveys of the two states. Again, that is not good reason for keeping them out of the GST. As per the current proposal, in the case of a real estate business, what would be taxed under the GST are the cost of construction materials and services provided by architects and contractors. But, a major component of a real estate product is land. This element shall remain untaxed under the GST, but taxes paid on land i.e., stamp duty cannot be set off as input tax credit and will cascade. This will also lead to real estate becoming more expensive. The current proposal provides for the levy of an additional tax of 1 percent on supply of goods in the course of inter-state trade. Now, this tax is non-VAT-able and so appears to be nothing but the Central Sales Tax called by another name. GST council fracture The governance structure of the GST calls for the setting up of a GST Council. In the council, the Centre will have 1/3rd share of votes; the balance 2/3rd distributed amongst states. The council is to make recommendations on all major issues such as rates (including rate bands), exemptions, threshold limits, model GST law, principles of levy, apportionment of IGST, principles that govern place of supply, etc. While it is a good idea to have the GST Council, in the context of the overriding revenue considerations of the states that seem to have guided the design of the GST so far, it could prove to be a stumbling block in introducing genuine reforms in the indirect tax framework. Remember that each state can and will have their own state GST law, and while the recommendations of the GST Council will be in the framework of a “harmonised structure” they are not binding on the states. So we may end up with a situation similar to the current reality with each state having roughly similar VAT laws which yet differ in several critical areas. In this scenario, the common market the GST wants to usher in will remain a distant dream. What about the hugely positive impact the GST is supposed to have on the business environment? In an excellent and telling analysis , Satya Poddar and Venkatesh Narayan show how the need for dealers to register in each and every state separately could create a nightmarish situation for tax compliance. As they point out, each registration will be treated as an independent entity even where these are branches of one company from which goods or services are being supplied. While at present a typical company with a pan-India operation files two semi-annual returns plus 12 monthly returns, this will go up by many multiples, depending on how many states it has operations in. In their example, the number could be higher than 1,600. This will certainly have a very negative effect on the costs of compliance and worsen the business environment in India, Finally, and most importantly, the proposal is yet to specify what would be the GST rate. It is to be decided by the revenue-minded GST Council. In discussions of a revenue neutral rate (RNR), with petroleum, alcohol, electricity, and land kept out of GST, a rate over 27 per cent has been talked about . Such a high rate will be anti-investment and growth, not to say inflationary. Of course, the Congress Party has insisted on an 18 percent cap to be specified in the law itself, and though the government is not in agreement on this point, it is likely to go for a rate near 18 percent. If the computation of a RNR of 27 percent is correct, a lower rate of 18 or 20 percent will lead to lower revenues. The Goods and Services Tax as proposed is certainly not a silver bullet.

I am a businessman… a SME… I know that GST will increase Business and spending by reducing costs! Yugantar Gupta The triple GST format too is horrible. If a business has to pay three different GSTs how is it different from the existing system. The proposed GST will make us worse off if we include the transition cost. Three separate returns have to be filed. Separate registration in each state, differences in State GST laws, how are we better off in any way? S.N.Iyer It is no secret that the NDA Govt’s major weakness is lack of adequate knowledge of economics!! The present comfortable position on CAD and fiscal deficit can be largely attributed to the low cost of imports of crude–the savings has been estimated to be Rs 70000cr ! Given he propensity for each State to improve their revenues by fiddling with the duties on alcohol and petroleum products plus other taxes on real estate, etc the GST may only help the easier movement of goods interstate, but overall revenues may not pan out as expected. Whatever rate is decided,while it may help in reducing some prices of higher taxed items, but lower taxed items will become more expensive. Service tax which now varies between 14/15% may increase. As a result it will be difficult to predict that GDP growth will be higher. One may argue that in time we will learn to manage the rate to benefit whom- the consumer or the Govt!! On a total different issue, every few years we get Finance Commissions giving increase but no recommendation on rationalizing the revenue outgo to a high percentage of staff is given any thought.Ultimately it is the difference between revenue earned and spent that determines growth!! ramanan The editorial staff must have basic minimum knowledge on these matters and if not consult people from industry and business to know how GST will improve their lot. This has to be seen at a holistic level. Currently, states are forcing arbitrage in favour of local sales and making movement of goods difficult. This is the bane of the current system. There is no sure way of arriving at a revenue neutral rate and may be there is no such thing as an RNR.

Time and money wont be wasted by trucks waiting to go through state border inspections. Thought on closer scrutiny there is a huge BUT here. The bill being proposed in its present form does not bring petroleum, tobacco and alcohol products under the preview of the GST for atleast the first few years. This is to allay the fears of the state governments for whom the taxes charged on these products are a major source of income. Also there are many industries like the airline and the IT services which are paying less taxes than the proposed 18% at present which also want exemptions. Exemptions are the biggest hurdle to the proper implementation of the GST. This bill has the potential to be a game changer for the Indian economy in the long term but the short term implications may be chaotic if the there are issues with the implementation . In the short term there are bound to be issues. The party passing the bill is destined to loose popularity. Just ask Canada and Malaysia . The party that passed the GST in Canada went from 55% majority in the parliament to just 2 seats in the next election !! The government is taking a huge risk by trying to get this bill passed. So the ultimate negative impact could be that the BJP and Modi go out of power in the next general elections :P. - A converted “bhakt”. 1.2k Views · View Upvotes Related Questions More Answers Below What are the negative aspects of GST?

Harleen Kaur , CA, Sharing information on taxes, Co-founder @ fintrakk.com Written 19w ago The prices of some goods may fall after successful implementation of GST.But,this is possible only if the benefit is actually passed on to the consumers .There are other factors also like the sellers profit margin that determine the final price of goods.GST alone does not determine the final price of goods. Negative Impact of GST : Services will become expensive.e.g.Telecom,banking,airline etc. Being a new tax,it will take some time for the people to understand its implications. It is easier said than done.There are always some complications attached. It is a consumption based tax,so in case of services the place where service is provided needs to be determined. If actual benefit is not passed to consumer and seller increases his profit margin,the prices of goods can also see a rising trend. However,GST is a long term strategy and the positive impact shall be seen in the long run only.This can happen if GST is introduced at a nominal rate (hope so)to reduce the overall tax burden of the final consumers. The rate of GST also plays a crucial role in deciding the actual impact of GST on the common man. Let us hope this “One nation,one tax” proves to be a game changer in a positive way and proves to be beneficial not only to the common man but to the country as a whole .

2,"What are the good sides and the bad sides of GST (goods and services tax)? - Quora This page may be out of date. Save your draft before refreshing this page. Submit any pending changes before refreshing this page. Hide this message . Quora Sign In Economics What are the good sides and the bad sides of GST (goods and services tax)? for us, the consumers as well as for the country Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers Deepak Kiran Kumar Written 133w ago The Goods and Service Tax is a system of taxation where there is a single tax in the economy for goods as well as services. This is meant to bring together the state economies and create a single taxation system in the entire country for all goods and services. It is based on a tax-on-value-add concept which avoids duplication of taxes.The GST when introduced can eliminate all the indirect taxes. The GST is worldwide accepted system. France is the first country that introduced this. GST is considered for the goods sold as well as for the services provided. The assumed rate of GST is about 16%-17%.This is much lesser when compared with the current rate of taxation. According to the current tax pattern, the tax rates about 35%-40% When GST is introduced the price of a product will become reduced. A fall in price generally increases the product demand. Not only the price reduces but also the working capital too. GST makes the price of a product unique throughout the country. The concept of warehouse changes when GST is introduced. In the present tax system a ware house is required for each state. If the dealer and the ware house are in different states, then the dealer needs to pay a Central Sales Tax of about 2%.This increases the price of the commodity. Thus companies use to setup a warehouse in each state. In GST as the CST gets eliminated, the number of warehouses can get reduced. GST is not much complicated as the current tax pattern which involves the calculation as well as the tabulation of various indirect taxes. This can also reduce much paperwork. There won’t be any GST charged on the Goods with the exempt category, 1% on bullion and a reduced rate for the essential item. The GST is a welcomed tax pattern as it can reduce the price of the Goods increasing the consumption and finally increases the production. Multiple taxes that currently exist will no longer remain in the picture. This means that taxes like octroi, CENVAT, central sales tax, state sales tax, entry tax, license fees, turnover tax etc will no longer be present and all that will be brought under the GST. Let us know how GST works in Malaysia: RM: Malaysian Ringgit In the current tax regime, The 10% Sales Tax (on manufacturing and imports) and 6% Service Tax (on the F&B and professional services industry) is collected by one party (usually the seller) and passed on to the tax authorities. For example, in the previous 6% Service Tax regime, when you buy a cup of coffee from Starbucks that says RM15 on the menu, you pay RM15.90 (including the current Service Tax of 6%). Starbucks will keep RM15 and pass on RM0.90 to the tax authorities. In a GST regime (6% GST in this calculation), the following happens: 1. Starbucks buys the coffee beans from the wholesaler to make your cup of coffee for RM10 (RM10+ 6% GST). The Wholesaler keeps RM10 and passes on RM0.60 from Starbucks to the tax authorities. 2. You buy that cup of coffee from Starbucks which the beans were used to make, and pay RM15.90 (RM15 + 6% GST). Starbucks now keeps RM15 and passes on RM0.30 to the tax authorities (RM0.90 – RM0.60). The reason why Starbucks only passes RM0.30 to the tax authorities is because they have effectively already ‘paid’ RM0.60 in tax earlier on the first RM10, and only RM0.30 tax is left to be paid on the RM5 “value-add”. We have graphically shown this example below. Disadvantages: Critics have argued that the GST is a regressive tax , which has a more pronounced effect on lower income earners, meaning that the tax consumes a higher proportion of their income, compared to those earning large incomes. A study commissioned by the Curtin University of Technology , Perth in 2000 argued that the introduction of the GST would negatively impact the real estate market as it would add up to 8 percent to the cost of new homes and reduce demand by about 12 percent. India has opted for a dual-GST model. Critics claim that CGST, SGST and IGST are nothing but new names for Central Excise/Service Tax, VAT and CST and hence GST brings nothing new to the table. The concept of value-add has never been utilised in the levy of service as the Delhi High Court is attempting to prove in the case of Home Solution Retail while under Central Excise the focus is on defining and refining the definition of manufacture instead of focusing on value additions. The Revenue can be very stubborn when it comes to refunds as the Maharashtra Government proves and software entities that applied for refunds on excess service tax paid on inputs discovered.

Why is FDI bad/good for the Indian economy? Wang Lei , Studied H2 Economics at Temasek Junior College Written 132w ago First of all, GST is an important source of revenue for government, especially for countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong, where the personal tax and corporate tax are low. With huge amount of GST collected, government can manage the country more effectively, which is obviously beneficial to both individual and the society as a whole. For example, the government can use the GST collected to build infrastructures such as hospitals and schools so that people get access to quality healthcare and education. GST can also be a tool for government to curb the overconsumption of undesirable goods. Government can set high GST for cigarette, alcoholic products and prostitution (if the government perceive sex industry as undesirable). Supply curve shifts up, quantity demanded drops (i.e. price increases, consumption decreases). In economics term, tax is varied across different goods and services so as to reduce the society's welfare deadweight loss due to overconsumption of demerit goods or goods that imposes negative externality. Moreover, GST can be used to implement fiscal policy. As a tax that is imposed economy-wide, GST can be raised or lowered to effectively manage the economy. For example, during economic downturn, GST should be reduced so that the equilibrium output of the society as well as the employment opportunities increase. Conversely, the government should raise tax level during booming period. It curbs the aggregate demand in the long run, hence cools down the economy (i.e. lowers the inflation). It is interesting that, by increasing tax, the general price level will eventually fall. The explanation is that in the short run, tax increase causes mild inflation, however, in the long run, consumers and companies have less money to spend and invest. Aggregate demand as well as price level fall in the long run. However, GST is not flawless. The blunt tax penalises everyone in the society equally, inclusive of both the rich and the poor. Unlike the income tax or corporate tax, GST is hardly progressive. It makes necessities such as food, transport, houses, clothing and medical treatment more expensive to the exact same extent to both the rich and the poor, adversely affecting the equity of the society. Fortunately, GST can be progressive if the government taxes more on luxuries and less on necessities. Moreover, government can construct strong transfer or welfare system to assist those financially needy citizens. Overall, GST brings more benefits than harms to society. That's precisely why most of the countries, if not all, collect GST. 56.3k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by Quora User Kerry Walsh Written 100w ago Wang Lei described the possible flaws perfectly.

There are a ton of articles out there that explain the effects of GST in a very unbiased way. Like you, there are ton of people out there that really want to understand and know what it will do once implemented. I listed some more reasons why GST is beneficial for Malaysia and also noted which article they came from if you wanted to look more into it: Under the current tax system, the Government depends too much on direct taxes, both from individual and corporate taxpayers. With the surprising fact that only 1.8 million Malaysians pay individual income taxes, our Government is running low on tax revenue collected. This is causing them to incur more debt each year to sustain their primary spending.

Gst is to consolidate all state economies.This will be one of the biggest taxation reforms that will take place in India once the bill gets officially the green signal to implement. The basic idea is to create a single,cooperative & undivided Indian market to make the economy stronger & powerful. The gst will see a significant breakthrough towards an all-inclusive indirect tax reform in the country. In the year 2000,for the 1st time, the idea of initiating the Gst was made by the then BJP Govt under the leadership of Atal Behari Vajpayee. An empowered committee was also formed for that,headed by Asim Desagupta( the then Finance Minister of the West Bengal Govt). The committee was formed to design the model of the GST & at the same time inspect the preparation of the IT rollout. Advantages of GST bill. Introduction of Gst is very useful in emerging environment of the Indian economy. It increases production & distribution of goods & services.separate taxes for goods & services,which is present taxation system,requires division of transaction values in to value of goods & services for taxation,leading to grater complications GST will be levied only at the final destination of consumption based on VAT principle & not at various points.This helps to remove economic distortions & bring abt development of a command national market According to experts,by implementing the Gst,India will gain $15 billion a year.This is because,it will promote more exports,create more employment opportunities & growth. It will divide the burden of tax between manufacturing & services. Disadvantages of GST bill First & foremost,the basic exemption limit in excise of Rs.1.5 crore will be taken away in Gst,thereby slowly killing the SSI. Thousands & lakhs of industries in India are surviving only for reason that they are not required to pay excise if their turnover does not exceed 1.5 crore.This had made their products cost efficient & saleable in market Certaintly,the big industrial houses are going to get benefited in massive way Another disadvantage is that overall economy would grow. The real wealth of our country also would grow. But this growth would be with out development. The majority of the people would be at the mercy of big bussiness houses. The rich would become more rich & the poor would be more poor. Huge inequalities in income & wealth would be visible 9.3k Views · View Upvotes Michael Smith Written 53w ago The good side of GST is that it replaces various indirect taxes such as Service Tax, Sale Tax, License Fee and Excise. A businessman can claim input credit tax upon paying GST. It indirectly lowers the cost of doing business and increases tax revenue of government. It helps to build a transparent and corruption-free government system that could spur economic development. The final tax burden of GST will ultimately be borne by consumers or end users. However, it ultimately goes back to the welfare of the consumers, through nation building programs, and infrastructure development.

However, due to political reasons, the Bill couldn’t pass the Lok Sabha’s approval since then. Today is a litmus test for Modi Govt. as the reformed GST Bill would be tabled at Rajya Sabha and discussions related to its passage would be held. GST or Goods and Services Tax Bill aims to create a uniform tax structure pan-India, removing several layers of taxation such as purchase tax, VAT or Sales Tax, state-level taxes like, entertainment tax, excise duty, entry tax, luxury tax and octroi. As per various analysts, GST Bill can increase India’s GDP by 2%. In order to remove the political logjam and to take Congress Party’s support for passing GST Bill, Govt. has amended several pointers which was earlier passed in Lok Sabha: – Removed the provision of 1% additional manufacturing tax for supplying goods so that non-manufacturing states doesn’t feel the pinch and stop revenue loss for them – During the first 5 years of GST’s implementation, Govt. has guaranteed to compensate any revenue loss to any state – A uniform GST rate would be accommodated which can protect the common man from high prices – Centre will leave control to tax any business which has turnover of less than Rs 1.5 crore RELATED: IT Dept Release Draft Rules Under GST Tax Filings; Now, Tax Payers May Need To File Monthly Returns – A dedicated dispute redressal system to be created pan-India Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) has already declared that if GST Bill is not passed, then it can destroy ecommerce sector . Assocham has hailed GST as the ‘Brahamastra’ for Indian economy ; and even USA has supported passing of GST as it can unleash a new wave of economic reforms. Positive Changes Once GST Is Passed – Due to various Centre and State taxes, a consumer today pays 25-27% more for a product, compared to what it actually costed to be manufactured. Although there is no mention of a cap, but as per experts, GST can be limited at 18-20% once approved in the Lok Sabha. Thus, the prices of goods can come down. – Prices of small cars and two-wheelers can drastically come down once GST Bill is approved . As of now, small cars which have length of less than 4 meters and engine capacity less than 1500 cc are taxed at 30.4%, which will come down to 18-20% with GST. A price drop of 10% is expected by the industry. However, prices of luxury cars won’t be affected. – Prices of movie tickets is also expected to drop – Prices of Made in India mobile phones and electronic gadgets can come down , as various Inter-state taxes would be removed and a uniform tax structure would be implemented. However, doubts persists among handset makers and they have requested the Govt. for more clarification RELATED: Rs 2256 Cr Project Saksham Approved To Integrate GST With Central Board of Excise & Customs’ IT Network – Govt. is pretty optimistic that ‘One Nation One Tax’ policy can stop corruption as well Negative Changes Once GST Is Passed – Effective service tax is presently 15%, which would increase to 18-20% once GST is passed. Hence, although prices of goods and products can come down, service industry will bear the brunt of higher taxes . – Air travel, hotels would become more expensive. Currently, economy class tickets are taxed 6% and non-economy class tickets are charged 9%. Once GST is implemented, it would increase to 18%, thereby leading to direct increase of 9-12% tax on the tickets . Unless the airlines absorb this increase, the additional tax has to be paid by the consumer – Insurance premiums, investments would be more expensive – Cigarettes, branded clothes, branded jewellery, and even mobile phone calls would be more expensive post GST A lot will change once GST Bill is approved, as there exists several clauses and conditions pertaining to inter-state movements, power of States to levy tax and/or remove tax and the issue of 93% workers in India who are working in unorganized sector.

Drag according to your convenience ET NOW RADIO ET NOW TIMES NOW GST impact across sectors: Take a look at the winners and losers By ET Bureau | Updated: Aug 04, 2016, 11.32 AM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » Telecom | tech | Media | insurance | GST | fmcg | Ecommerce RELATED VIDEO GST passed after a decade: Political leaders react GST will turn India into one common market, leading to greater ease of doing business and big savings in logistics costs from companies across all sectors. Some companies will gain more as the GST rate will be lower than the current tax rates they pay, others will lose as the rate will be higher than the present effective rate. While the rate of GST is yet to be decided, industry observers have assumed an 18% rate recommended by a government panel in making their impact calculations. ET looks at the likely impact across sectors. TECH Positive GST will eliminate multiple levies. It will also allow deeper penetration of digital services. Negetive IT companies can have several delivery centres and offices working together to service a single contract. With GST, companies might require each centre to generate a separate invoice to every contracting party. Duty on manufactured goods is going to go up from existing 14-15% to 18%, which means the cost of electronics from mobile phones to laptops- will rise. Also read: GST to boost positive sentiment: Sunil Kanoria, Assocham president FMCG Positive Companies could generate substantial savings in logistics and distribution costs as the need for multiple sales depots will be eliminated. FMCG companies pay nearly 24-25% including excise duty, VAT and entry tax. GST at 17-19% could yield significant reduction in taxes. Warehouse rationalisation and reduction of overall tax rates, is expected to generate saving which could cumulatively range between 200-300bps. Key beneficiaries : Hindustan Unilever, Colgate, GSK, Asian Paints Negative If the recommended 40% ""sin/demerit"" GST for aerated beverages and tobacco products is levied, then prices may increase by over 20%. Food companies: many see increase in effective tax as many companies enjoy concessional rate of excise. ECOMMERCE Positive GST will help create a single unified market across India and allow free movement and supply of goods in every part of the country. It will also eliminate the cascading effect of taxes on customers which will bring efficiency in product costs. Negative The tax collection at source (TCS) guidelines in the GST regime will increase administration, documentation workload for ecommerce firms and push up costs. TELECOM Positive Handset prices likely to come down/even out across states. Manufacturers are also likely to pass on to consumers cost benefits they will get from consolidating their warehouses and efficiently managing inventory. For handset makers, GST will bring in ease of doing business as they may no longer need to set up state specific entities and transfer stocks to them and invest heavily into logistics of creating warehouses in each state across the country. Negative Call charges, data rates will go up if tax rate in the GST regime exceeds 15%. Tower firms won't be able to set off their input duty liabilities if petro-products continue to stay outside GST framework. Negative for Bharti Airtel, Idea and Reliance Comm. AUTOMOBILES Positive On-road price of vehicles could drop by 8%, as per a report by Motilal Oswal Securities. Lower prices can be construed as indirect stimulus to boost volumes. Key beneficiaries: Maruti Suzuki, M&M; Eicher Motors' margins may expand. Negative Demand for commercial vehicles may be hit in the medium term. GST will subsume local taxes, reduce time at check-posts, ease logistics hurdles. With fleet productivity increasing, operators may not feel the need to expand mid-term. MEDIA Positive DTH, film producers and multiplex players are levied service tax as well as entertainment tax, GST will bring major change and uniformity in businesses. Taxes could go down by 2-4%. Multiplex chains will save on revenues as there will be a more uniform tax, unlike current high rate of entertainment tax levied by different states. It may lower the average ticket price, and increase the footfalls in multiplexes. GST will be a big boon to film producers and studios that currently pay service tax on most of their cost, but cannot charge input credit on creative services (payments to artists etc) as they fall under the negative list. Under GST, they will be able to claim credit of these services also, which will help is lowering the overall cost. Key beneficiaries : Dish TV, PVR. Also read: Experts say GST can be rolled out in FY18 INSURANCE Negative Insurance policies: life, health and motor will begin to cost more from April 2017 as taxes will go up by up to 300 basis points. AIRLINES Negative Flying to become expensive, as service tax will be replaced by GST. Service tax on fares currently range between 6% and 9% (depending on the class of travel). With GST, the rate will surpass 15%, if not 18%, effectively doubling the tax rate. CEMENT Positive The effective rate of tax for cement companies is now 25%. If GST rates are fixed at 18-20% then the overall tax incidence will be lower GST IS expected to lead to savings in transportation cost, which currently comprises up to 20-25% of total revenue. One common market will bring down the number of depots in the country. Ultratech states that its depots will come down to 100 from 550 at present. Key beneficiaries : Pan India players such as UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja and Shree Cement. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Drag according to your convenience ET NOW RADIO ET NOW TIMES NOW GST will change the way India does business: Who will win, who will lose Updated: Aug 03, 2016, 11.28 AM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » VAT | Service tax | Indirect Taxes | GST | Business By Anand Laddha & Sahil Kapoor Indirect taxes in India have driven businesses to restructure and model their supply chain and systems owing to multiplicity of taxes and costs involved. With hopes that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will see the light of the day, the way India does business will change, forever. Total tax collection in India (direct & indirect), currently stands at Rs 14.6 lakh crore, of which almost 34 per cent comprises indirect taxes, with Rs 2.8 lakh crore coming from excise and Rs 2.1 lakh crore from service tax . With the implementation of the GST (Goods and Services Tax), the entire indirect tax system in India (excise, state-level VAT , service tax) is expected to evolve. The tax revenue mix can change as per the economic condition of the country. In developing countries, indirect taxes comprise a higher share of total taxes; in developed countries, their contribution is significantly lower. For example in Australia, indirect tax contributes just 13 per cent of total tax collection. After GST, the percentage of indirect tax is expected to increase in India. Not covered under the GST purview: 1. Petroleum products 2. Entertainment and amusement tax levied and collected by panchayat /municipality/district council 3. Tax on alcohol/liquor consumption 4. Stamp duty, customs duty 5. Tax on consumption and sale of electricity GST objectives:- 1. Ensuring availability of input credit across the value chain 2. Minimising cascading effect of taxation 3. Simplification of tax administration and compliance 4. Harmonisation of tax base, laws, and administration procedures across the country 5. Minimising tax rate slabs to avoid classification issues 6. Prevention of unhealthy competition among states 7. Increasing the tax base and raising compliance Implementation challenges:- 1. Lack of adaptation 2. Lack of trained staff 3. Double registration can increase compliances and cost 4. Lack of clear mechanism to control tax evasion 5. Hard to estimate the exact impact of GST Impact on inflation: Under the proposed GST, effective tax rate on goods (comprising around 70-75 per cent of the CPI basket) will decline. A significant proportion (35-40 per cent) of goods (majorly agriculture products) are not subject to tax and we expect a status quo in future. At present, services-oriented components constitute ~25-30 per cent of the CPI basket with a major share belonging to housing, transport and communication sector . Service tax is not imposed on certain (12 per cent of the CPI basket) services and these services are expected remain exempt under GST regime. A hike in tax rate on services is unlikely to have any material direct impact on CPI. Thus, the overall transition to GST will not have a significant impact on inflation Sector wise impact of GST:- Automobiles: The effective tax rate in the sector currently ranges between 30 per cent and 47 per cent. Highlights:- ? On implementation of GST the tax rate is expected to oscillate between 20-22 per cent. ? It is expected to drive overall demand and reduce cost for the end user by about 10 per cent. ? The transportation time and the overall cost will be reduced as the goods will be transferred from one state to another by easily surpassing various octroi and check points. ? In addition to this, the cost for the logistics and supply chain inventory will be curtailed by almost 30-40 per cent. Impact: In a long run, GST is expected to remain positive for automobile sector. Key beneficiaries: Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, Ashok Leyland Consumer durables The current tax rate for the sector ranges between 7 per cent and 30 per cent. Highlights:- ? The implementation of GST will essentially benefit companies, which have not availed tax exemptions in the past. ? It will lead to the reduction of the price gap between the organised and unorganised sector. ? The warehouse/logistics costs across the operational and non-operational segments will be curtailed. This will improve the operational profitability by almost 300-400 bps. ? The 7th Pay Commission is also expected to boost demand and fund inflow in the consumer durables sector by the end of the year. Impact: The impact may remain neutral or negative, specifically for companies which either enjoy tax exemptions or fall under the concessional tax bracket. Key beneficiaries: CGCE, Havells, Voltas, Blue Star, Bajaj Electricals, Symphony, Hitachi FMCG Impact: The impact may remain neutral or negative, specifically for companies which either enjoy tax exemptions or fall under the concessional tax bracket. Key beneficiaries: CGCE, Havells, Voltas, Blue Star, Bajaj Electricals, Symphony, Hitachi Furnishing and home decor Impact: Currently, the effective tax rate for the sector ranges above 20 per cent. Highlights:- ? After the implementation of GST, paints and other construction chemicals companies will benefit from lower tax rate. ? At present, the market share for the organised sector is about 65-70 per cent. Effective tax correction practices under the GST regime will ensure that the price difference amongst the unorganised sector and the organised sector is narrowed. This will improve opportunities for the organised sector. ? The overall cost and competitiveness in products such as like ceramic tiles, faucets, sanitary ware and plywood & laminates manufacturer will be curbed. Impact: - Implementation of GST is expected to bring the unorganised sector under a uniform tax base and improve growth opportunities for the organised sector. Key beneficiaries: Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac, Akzo Nobel, BASF India, Pidilite, HSIL , Cera Sanitaryware, Greenply, Greenlam Industries, H&R Johnson (Prism Cements), Kajaria Ceramics Logistics Highlights: The implementation of GST will lead to lower transit time and thereby generate higher truck utilisation. This will boost demand for high tonnage trucks and lead to overall reduction in transportation costs. It will facilitate seamless inter-state flow of goods, which is expected to directly accelerate demand for logistics services. Impact: The logistics sector is largely fragmented and comprises many unorganized players. Several players in the unorganised sector avoid tax which generates a cost gap between them and the organized players. With the GST coming into picture, we expect an overall positive impact, with a reduction in the cost competitiveness as all the players will be brought under a uniform tax base, thereby improving growth opportunities for the organized players. Key beneficiaries: VRL Logistics, GATI, Blue Dart, Transport Corporation of India, Snowman Logistics Cement Currently, the tax on cement ranges between 27 per cent and 32 per cent. Highlights:- ? The tax rate for the cement sector is expected to decline to 18-20 per cent under the GST regime. ? This is expected to lead to savings in the transportation cost, which currently comprises up to 20-25 per cent of total revenue. ? Thereby, overall realisations of cement companies will substantially improve post GST rollout. Impact: The impact of GST will be positive, as the companies will also be able to save on their logistic costs, due to rationalisation of warehouses and lower transportation costs (due to decline transit time). Key beneficiaries: ACC, Ultratech, JK Cement, Shree Cement. Entertainment We have divided in two main categories i.e. Multiplexes and Media. We expect a significant impact on both the sectors after implementation of GST. Multiplexes: This category attracts different taxes such as service tax, entertainment tax and VAT among others. Currently, the effective tax ranges between 22-24 per cent. Highlights: ? It is expected GST tax rate will trickle down to 18-20%. ? Reduction in taxes will lead to an increase in average ticket price (ATP) and higher revenue. ? There exist several challenges pertaining to: ? Availablity of limited credit for service tax paid on lease rentals, maintenance cost, advertisements, security charges. ? No credit is available on the taxes paid on capital expenditure. ? The VAT credit on available on the purchase of F&B can be offset against VAT liability on F&B sales. ? Entertainment tax rate on box office collections ranges between 22-24 per cent and the same is not cenvatable against any input taxes. These will be addressed after the implementation of GST. Impact: The overall impact is expected to be positive and the Ebitda margins of the players are expected to increase by 250-350 bps. Key beneficiaries: PVR, Inox Leisure Media Currently, the effective tax rate for the DTH providers ranges between 20-21 per cent ( this includes service tax of 14 per cent and entertainment tax of around 5-7 per cent). The effective tax range for the broadcasters is around 14-15 per cent. Highlights:- ? On implementation of GST, a blanket rate of around 18-20 per cent will apply, which is lower than current tax rate for the DTH provider and higher for the broadcaster. ? Currently the news and print sector is exempted from all indirect taxes. Post GST, we expect concessional rates to be introduced in this sector. Impact:- ? Implementation of GST will be healthy for the DTH providers and downbeat for broadcasters. ? The overall impact on the news and print sector will be neutral. Key beneficiary: Dish TV Marginally negative : Zee, Sun, HT Media and Jagran Prakashan Textiles/garments The effective tax rate for the sector currently ranges between 6-7 per cent Highlights:- ? Under the GST regime, there is no clarity whether a lower rate will continue for the readymade garments. ? Companies may be negatively impacted in case the output tax rate is high. ? Going forward, several export companies may also avail duty drawback benefits. Though we await more clarity on the impact of these benefits. Key players to be impacted: Arvind, Raymond, Page Industries Pharma Currently, the sector enjoys various location-based tax incentives. The effective tax rate (excise duty) for most companies is much below the statutory tax rate (6 per cent). Highlights:- ? The concessional tax bracket for the sector is expected to continue. ? The existing tax exemptions will continue until expiry of the tax exemption period. Going forward it will be difficult to bring forth the new exemptions. ? GST is also expected to address inverted duty structure and lower logistic costs for the sector. Impact: It is expected remain neutral for the pharmaceutical sector. IT & ITeS Currently, the IT industry is subject to an effective tax rate of 14 per cent. Highlights:- ? The tax rate under GST is expected to increase to 18-20 per cent. ? The industry earns a large part of its revenue from exports, which will continue to be exempt under GST. ? Litigation around taxability of canned software will probably end under GST regime as there will be no distinction between goods and services. Impact: It is expected to range from being neutral to slightly negative. Telecom Currently, telecommunication services are subject to service tax of 14 per cent. Highlights:- ? The tax rate is expected to increase to 18 per cent under GST. ? It is expected that the telecom companies may pass the increased tax burden on postpaid subscribers. ? Availability of input tax credit will lower the sector's capex cost. Impact: Increase in effective tax rate may be marginally negative for the sector. The telecommunication companies may not be able to pass on all the increase in taxes to all the end consumers, especially the ones in the lower Arpu prepaid segment. Metal Currently, the effective tax rate for base metal products is 19-21 per cent: ? VAT ranges from 4-5% depending on the state ? Excise 12.5%, CST 2% and entry taxes in respective states. Impact: Under GST, it is not known whether metal products will attract a special rate that is lower than the standard GST rate. Banking and financial services Currently the effective tax rate is 14 per cent, which is levied only on fee component (and not interest) of the transaction. Highlights:- ? Under GST, effective tax rate on fee-based transactions is expected to increase to 18-20%. ? As the taxs on the input services will increase, operating expenses (comprising of rent, legal & professional fee, advertisement, insurance, telecommunication and other expenses) will also increase marginally. Impact: With the implementation of GST a moderate increase in the cost of financial services such as loan processing fees, debit/credit card charges, insurance premiums, etc. is expected.

Hence patients cannot expect substantial savings on their medical bills, once `one nation one tax' is implemented across the country. There is uncertainty whether the healthcare sector as well as life-saving drugs and medical devices will continue to be exempt from taxes and levies, once the GST is rolled out. Says Hitesh Sharma, Tax Partner and leader life sciences, EY India, ""The impact on pharma is rate-dependent, and if the impact is upto 12%, it will be neutral"". Pharma companies are yet to do the math, but feel that the tax reform will result in supply chain savings and operational efficiency. ""This is a phenomenal change, and will lead to better logistics and efficiency in operations"", Annaswamy Vaidheesh VP, South Asia & managing director, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals told TOI. Ranjit Shahani, VC and MD of Novartis India, feels that the move needs to be viewed in terms of the big picture, pure arithmetic and operational efficiency it involves. ""Only if there are substantial net savings for companies, will they pass on the benefit (to consumers)"", he says. Says Krishan Arora director, Grant Thornton India, ""With the GST regime coming in, healthcare services, which are currently exempt from output taxes, may continue to be exempt from GST given the importance of this sector. However, this could lead to cost of such services going up due to increase in procurement costs of goods and services on account of increase in overall GST rates. On the other hand, pharma companies could expect some positives from GST on account of seamless flow ?of tax credits and streamlining of overall compliance framework. However, it would need to be seen what treatment is accorded to existing indirect tax exemptions/ concessions and inverted tax structures that are prevalent in the existing framework to ensure that the overall costs of pharma products do not increase on account of GST."" The Industry would also be looking forward to a beneficial tax treatment for goods manufactured in tax-free zones such as Baddi, a simpler valuation mechanism for levy of GST on stock transfer and zero rating in case of free supplies such as physician samples. ""The overall tax impact could also depend on the locations where these companies manufacture their products, as it is not yet clear whether the tax waivers given by states such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand will continue in the GST regime thereby impacting the costing,"" Suresh Nair, partner of indirect tax, EY said Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

7," GST : What is the impact of GST on the common man ? | Finance & Taxation Tips for Indian Investors Home About Q & A Forum PPF Calculator Top Menu Home About Q & A Forum PPF Calculator Privacy Policy Disclaimer Finance & Taxation Tips for Indian Investors Finance Investment Taxation The NRI corner View Infographics Your Queries Your Tax Calendar GST : What is the impact of GST on the common man ? admin August 8, 2016 GST : What is the impact of GST on the common man ? 2016-12-20T13:10:09+00:00 Taxation 3 Comments GST Bill has been passed in the Rajya Sabha, further ratified by the requisite number of states.Even the President has given his assent to the GST Bill. So,the implementation of GST is nearing reality. All the necessary steps are being taken for the effective implementation of GST or Goods and Services Tax from April 2017 in India. GST has been a hot topic of discussion everywhere these days.So,you need to be aware of different aspects of GST. How it will impact our lives,once GST is introduced ? How the common man will benefit from GST ? What are the advantages and disadvantages of GST ? Keep reading further, to have a deeper insight of the positive as well as the negative Impact of GST on common man. Presently, there are around 160 countries that have implemented GST/VAT in some form or other . In some countries,VAT is the substitute for GST,but conceptually it is a destination based tax levied on consumption of goods and services. France was the first to introduce GST or Goods and Services tax. Presently,only Canada has a dual GST model (somewhat similar to the Dual GST Model that India is going to implement). The rate of GST normally ranges in between 15–20% .However,it may differ to a higher/lower side in some of the countries. The rate of GST plays a crucial role, that is yet to be decided.Various countries have been struggling to rationalize the rate structure. India is all set to introduce GST or Goods and services tax after crossing the various hurdles in its way. Let us hope it is introduced at a nominal rate that proves beneficial not only for the common man but for the country as a whole. What is GST or Goods & Services tax and What is its Impact on the Common Man ? GST or Goods and Services Tax as the name implies,it is an indirect tax applied both on goods and services at a uniform rate.This means goods and services will be subject to a uniform tax rate and both will be treated at par.A single form of tax known as GST or Goods and services tax will be applied throughout the country,replacing a number of other indirect taxes like VAT,Service tax,CST,CAD etc. GST or Goods and Services Tax – A new law,a new tax will bring with it new challenges to face that need to be tackled with utmost care. So, GST bill covers the Goods and Services Tax and shall be the biggest indirect tax reform providing a uniform and simplified way of Indirect taxation in India.Once introduced GST will replace a number of other indirect taxes like VAT,CST,Service tax,CAD,SAD, Excise,Entry tax,purchase tax etc. So, a bundle of indirect taxes will get replaced by a new tax in India known as GST or Goods and Services Tax .Hence,leading to a much simplified tax regime as compared to the earlier complicated tax structure comprising of numerous taxes. As and when a new reform or bill comes and a new law is imposed,it surely leaves its impact especially on the common man.It is ultimately the common man who is directly or indirectly affected by the implementation of any new tax. Same applies in case of GST wherein the common man being the final consumer of goods shall be directly affected after introduction of GST. Here,we have tried to cover up the major points related to Impact of GST on the common man or the final consumer . Simply stated,we have highlighted the main advantages and disadvantages of GST and how GST will affect the common man . ** Important note : On 3rd November,2016 a four tier GST rate structure has been passed, the final slab rates being agreed upon are 5%,12%,18% and 28%. Final GST Slab rates are : Zero rated items : Foodgrains used by common people. ( A sigh of relief…hmmm…) 5% Rate : Items of mass consumption including essential commodities will have low tax incidence. 12% and 18 % Rate : Two standard rates have been finalised as 12% and 18%. 28% Rate : White goods like Air conditioners,washing machines,refrigerators,soaps and shampoos etc.that were taxed at 30-31% shall be now taxed at 28%. Demerit goods like tobacco,tobacco products,pan masala,aerated drinks and luxury cars shall be charged at the highest rate of 28% .An additional cess on some luxury goods shall also be imposed. Services that are now taxed at 15% shall be taxed at a higher rate of GST @ 18% . The tax rate on Gold is yet to be decided. It is infact too early to predict the actual impact of GST on different sectors. The final classification of goods in each of the above category shall be released very soon by the GST Council. Positive Impact of GST on the Common man or Advantages of GST : A unified tax system removing a bundle of indirect taxes like VAT,CST,Service tax,CAD,SAD,Excise etc. Less tax compliance and a simplified tax policy as compared to earlier tax structure. Removes cascading effect of taxes i.e. removes tax on tax . Due to lower burden of taxes on the manufacturing sector,the manufacturing costs will be reduced ,hence prices of consumer goods likely to come down. Due to reduced costs some products like cars,FMCG etc.will become cheaper . This will help in lowering the burden on the common man i.e.you will have to shed less money to buy the same products which were earlier costly. The low prices will further lead to an increase in the demand/consumption of goods. Increased demand will lead to increase supply.Hence,this will ultimately lead to rise in the production of goods . The increased production will lead to more job opportunities in the long run.But,this can happen only if consumers actually get cheaper goods. It will curb circulation of black money. This can happen only if the “kacha bill” system,normally followed by traders and shopkeepers is put to check. A unified tax regime will lead to less corruption which will indirectly affect the common man. Most importantly,GST will help to boost the Indian economy in the long run. But,this is possible only if the actual benefit of GST is passed on to the final consumers. There are various other factors also like the sellers profit margin that determine the final price of goods .GST alone does not determine the final price of goods. For a detailed analysis,here are some good books on GST or Goods and Services tax that might help you as a beginner in understanding GST in a simple manner. Negative Impact of GST on the Common man or Disadvantages of GST : Service tax rate @ 15% is presently charged on the services. So,if GST is introduced at a higher rate which is likely to be seen in the near future,the cost of services will rise. In simple words,all the services like telecom,banking,airline etc. will become more expensive . Increased cost of services means, an add on to your monthly expenses . You will have to reschedule your budgets to bear the additional services cost. An increase in inflation might be seen initially. Being a new tax,it will take some time for the people to understand it completely.Its actual implications can be seen only when the rate of tax is determined. It is easier said than done.There are always some complications attached. It is a consumption based tax,so in case of services the place where service is provided needs to be determined. If actual benefit is not passed to the consumer and the seller increases his profit margin ,the prices of goods can also see a rising trend. A strict check on profiteering activities will have to be done, so that the final consumer can enjoy the real benefits of GST. Although,a large number of officers are being trained and a systematic IT software is being developed for the successful implementation of GST. But, it will take some time for the people including the manufacturers,the wholesalers,the retailers or the final consumers to understand the whole process and apply it correctly . However,GST or Goods and Services tax is a long term strategy planned by the Government and its positive impact shall be seen in the long run only.Also,this can happen if GST is introduced at a nominal rate (hope so)to reduce the overall tax burden of the final consumers. The rate of GST and how effectively GST is introduced in all the States and at the Centre also plays a crucial role in deciding the actual impact of GST on the common man. A well designed GST Policy can bring a qualitative change in the tax system of India. A massive IT Software is being developed for the successful implementation of GST and bring things online.Revenue officials are also being trained for turning GST into a reality.But,the actual performance and results can be visualised once GST is implemented. Talking about the different sectors, some might gain,some might lose .But,ultimately we will have to get used to this new tax,that is going to be a landmark reform having a great impact on India and its taxation system. Have a look at the Infographic below, that will give you an overview of GST or Goods and Services tax : Let us hope GST or Goods and services tax leaves a positive impact and helps to boost up the Indian economy and convert India into a unified national market with simplified tax regime. A rising Indian economy will anyways help in the financial growth of the common man ! Let us hope this “One nation,one tax” proves to be a game changer in a positive way and proves to be beneficial not only to the common man but to the country as a whole.

The tax paid on all purchases is called the output tax and the tax levied on all sales is called the Input tax. A GST registered enterprise pays tax to the government only if the output tax for the assessment period is more than the input tax paid by it. However, should the reverse be true, then the enterprise is entitled to a refund from the government within a declared period. GST is designed to make the final consumer bear the burden of tax and spare the business of its incidence. It does so by introducing a mechanism that allows for the refund of tax that is levied on intermediate transactions between firms. The proposed GST is likely to be a dual system that will support a Central and State GST chain separately. These two chains would be independent of each other. This implies that GST registered companies will not be able to adjust the input credits of one chain against the other. The Central GST chain is likely to integrate the existing excise duty and service taxes levied at the central level while the State level GST chain the current State-level VAT, other local levies and services tax on certain specific services on which States may get the powers to levy service tax. The input tax credit adjustments will operate within the respective chains but not across. The cumulative incidence of the excise duty and the State VAT at present works out to around 24 per cent of the retail sales price. Under GST, the aggregate is expected to be significantly lower. The government is likely to start with a GST of 15% thereabouts and reduce it progressively as the tax base expands. In advanced economies, the introduction of GST is usually accompanied by significant cuts in personal income tax as a means to reduce the income tax burden of the lower income segments that ends up paying tax that is disproportionately higher to their Income than the higher.

10," 7 ways GST affects India's infrastructure sector - Rediff.com Business HOME NEWS BUSINESS MOVIES SPORTS CRICKET GET AHEAD SHOPPING rediff NewsApp Rediff News All News NewsApp (Free) Read news as it happens SHOP FOR: Men's Lifestyle Women's Lifestyle Mobiles Electronics Watches Home & Decor Personal Care Health & Fitness Books All Categories Sign in | Create a Rediffmail account Rediff.com » Business » 7 ways GST affects India's infrastructure sector 7 ways GST affects India's infrastructure sector Share Comment To get such articles in your inbox Text size: A A A August 23, 2016 13:08 IST There are both positive and negative impacts of the tax, but the net result for India's infrastructure sector is advantageous, says Vinayak Chatterjee. T his is GST (goods and services tax) season; and as the dust settles on the commencement of the long journey to implement the historic GST regime, it is worthwhile to take stock of how it impacts specific aspects of Indian infrastructure. Here are seven ways GST affects the sector - three positive, and four negative. E lectricity (impact: negative): GST is expected to inflate electricity costs by up to eight per cent as the government has decided to keep electricity out of the ambit of this new tax dispensation. Power producing companies - both renewable and conventional - would have to pay GST for their inputs such as fuel and machinery but will not be able to get these taxes refunded, given that their output - electricity - is exempt. This higher cost of producing electricity will then be passed on to consumers under the “change of law” clause in power purchase agreements (PPA). Developers selling electricity in the spot market or on a non-PPA basis would have to factor in the higher cost. W orks contracts and EPC (impact: positive): GST seeks to provide much-needed clarity on works contracts, and therefore, on the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business line. Works contracts are proposed to be taxed as “services”. This means the GST rate and provisions, like place of supply rules et al, as applicable on services will apply to works contracts. The major gain from this treatment is that the tax would be now charged on the actual contractual base. Also, local versus inter-state works contracts, that at present leads to innumerable disputes, should get eliminated. Hence, EPC contract prices should come down somewhat on account of this new tax-efficient structure, which in turn should benefit project owners. C ement (impact: positive): Cement is a crucial input to the infra sector, and GST is expected to impact it positively. The overall indirect tax incidence is currently estimated to be around 25 per cent. The cement industry is also expected to benefit from lower costs of logistics. Overall, a decrease in cement prices is expected. L ogistics (impact: positive): The GST is expected to enable a reduction in logistics cost by as much as 20 per cent to 30 per cent, as firms reconfigure their supply chains on four counts. First, as India becomes one big market, there will be larger but fewer warehouses. Second, it will lead to a larger number of bigger trucks on roads as there is greater adoption of the hub-and-spoke model. Third, these changes will lead to greater economies of scale for transport operators and lead to more companies outsourcing their logistics operations. Four, reduction in waiting and idling time at inter-state barriers and checkpoints is expected to provide a huge relief. A dvisory, consulting, engineering and project management services (impact: negative): As with all other services, firms providing these services to the infrastructure sector will have a negative impact due to the higher incidence of GST at 17 to 18 per cent vis-à-vis the current 15 per cent. A bolition of tax holidays and exemptions (impact: negative): There are different tax holidays and exemptions for infrastructure development and operations at both the central and state levels. Whilst there is the hope that in the final analysis, these tax holidays and exemptions will be allowed to run their course, the lurking fear is that they will be removed. C ivil aviation (impact: negative): Five petroleum products - crude, natural gas, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), diesel and petrol - are excluded from the coverage of GST for the initial years while the remaining petroleum products - kerosene, naptha and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - are covered. Flight tickets are likely to get costlier as airlines will not be able to claim credit on tax paid on jet fuel. The current service tax ranges from 5.6 per cent to nine per cent of the base fare, which is considerably less than the GST rate that is being spoken about, of 15 to 18 per cent. Currently, airlines can claim what is called a cenvat credit on the central excise duty for fuel. They stand to lose this in the GST regime as ATF is outside the purview of GST. While there is this bundle of negatives and positives, this columnist is of the opinion that on the whole, GST has a positive impact on the sector. Increase in prices of airline tickets and electricity are soon absorbed and forgotten. But the positives that emanate from rationalisation of taxes on works contracts, reduction in cement prices, the huge benefit to logistics and the elimination of a raft of complex exemptions and tax holidays has clear long-term advantages.

Is Goods & Services Tax (GST) Simply Overrated? Logistics & Warehousing Goods and Services Tax a Panacea for all woes? Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in his element when he congratulated the country on the passage of the much-touted Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill in the Upper House of the Parliament, claiming that the new tax regime will rid the country of tax-terrorism. The tax regime which was proposed about a decade back as the panacea that would clean up the messy and complex indirect tax structure of the country, is expected to give India’s GDP a fillip, apart from boosting exports. “Expected” is the word. While GST has become popular as a ‘One Nation-One Tax’ formulation, the realities of implementation may be more complicated than political negotiations in the Parliament. Truth is GST, for which the ruling administration has set a go-live date of April 1, 2017, is in no way a one-tax rule. As things stand, the Centre has agreed to subsume excise duty, additional excise duty, service tax, countervailing duty, surcharge and cess, and central sales tax into the waiting arms of GST. The States have agreed to give up VAT (sales tax), entertainment tax, luxury tax, taxes on gambling, octroi and entry taxes, cess and purchase tax. GST will thus replace all of these taxes. The all-important tax rate though remains to be agreed upon. A wait of more than a decade came to an end on August 3, 2016, when the 122nd Constitution Amendment Bill, 2014 (popularly known as GST Bill) was passed by the Upper House of the Parliament of India. This is apparently the country’s biggest tax reform since Independence.Some achievement therefore for the Indian democracy. The new tax regime, which subsumes all indirect taxes such as sales tax and excise tax, is expected to bring down tax rates in India, while converting the country into a big single market. In short, now, seamless flow of goods and services will occur across 29 states and 7 union territories! Many believe the landmark Goods and Services Tax Bill (GST) passed by the two houses of the Parliament – after years of back and forth by the ruling party and main opposition (both the present ruling and main opposition parties have supported and opposed the Bill depending on whether they were in power or in the opposition) – is a key step that would catapult India into the big league in global supply chain. The implementation of the Bill is expected to ease India’s cumbersome tax system, help goods move seamlessly across state borders, curb tax evasion, improve compliance, increase revenues, spur growth, boost exports, and attract investments by improving ease of doing business in India. In short, GST when implemented, is expected to perform miracles. But, can it really? And considering that the Bill still needs to be ratified by at least 13 more state legislatures (over and above the three states Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand,which had already passed the bill, as on August 22, 2016) before the President of India can notify the GST Council to decide on the new tax rate and other issues with respect to GST, will it be a easy journey for the GST to the finish line? India is by no means the first country to experiment with a unified tax regime.160 countries already have some form of GST or a value added tax. What makes GST in India special is that as opposed to a federally administered regime, the Union and state governments will jointly administer India’s dual GST. This means it will be a set of many different taxes – a GST for each of the 29 states and two union territories (SGST), a Central GST (CGST), and an Integrated GST (IGST; which will be a combine of CGST and SGST on inter-state supplies of goods and services). That surely is not as unified as it seems. Interestingly, India will be one of the very few countries with a dual GST regime alongside Canada and Brazil. The all-important rate is yet to be finalised, with the final standard rate possibly lying between 15% to 27%, though 18% is the rate that seems to be gaining a sort of consensus amongst pundits. The problem though is that the pundits won’t decide the rate! GST rate will be decided in the coming months by a GST Council that will prise the Finance Minister with a representative from each state government. As such it will be negotiated amongst the Union and state governments that will jointly administer the GST regime. It will still remain complex and difficult to implement, but would surely make life easier for businesses by cutting down, or rather combining, the many indirect taxes that companies file in India. Foreign media has called GST one of the world’s most complex tax reforms that needs to be supported and serviced by state-of-the-art technology. And Infosys, the Indian software giant, has already started building a massive electronic infrastructure – a GST portal (GSTP) – where taxpayers can register, make payments and file returns. It is expected that some 7.5 million businesses will be covered by the tax. But then there are several questions that have been doing rounds since the day the Bill was passed in Rajya Sabha. What will really be the impact of GST on India’s manufacturing and service sectors? What will be a realistic timeframe for its implementation? How difficult will the implementation process be given the dual nature? What would be an ideal timeframe by which benefits will be realised? And above all, what will be the impact on exports from key sectors? The long queues of goods carriers at checkpoints should become a thing of the past with the implementation of GST. In India, trucks, according to some estimates, on an average, spend 48 hours per trip at various check-posts. (Image Source: The Dollar Business) BUSINESS MADE EASY One factor where the industry has clearly been in consensus is that GST being a destination based tax (where the tax is not applied at the point of production but at the point of supply or consumption),will make life easier for businesses in India. Companies will not have to file tax returns with multiple departments, but there will be just one web-based form to file tax returns. The country will finally become one common market, with uniform pricing across states, and optimal allocation of resources, making our goods more competitive. “Undoubtedly the most significant reform since the liberalisation in 1991, GST will transform India’s economic landscape. Unifying the $2 trillion economy and its 1.3 billion people under a uniform tax code, makes our country one of the most attractive destinations for business. I am confident that this game-changing legislation will propel India into a $20 trillion economy in the decades to come,” says Anil Agarwal, Chairman, Vedanta Group. Apart from this, there will be a very strong positive impact on the logistics sector. There is no one in India who has not seen the serpentine queues of goods carrying vehicles standing at inter-state check posts for inspection and payment of taxes. Even Shaktikanta Das, Economic Affairs Secretary, Ministry of Finance, GoI, is on record saying that trucks on an average spend 48 hours stranded at different check-posts every trip. The GST in ‘one fell swoop’ will remove these barriers, thus making India a preferred destination for business. “GST will revolutionise logistics with unified and simplified structure versus multiple taxes at various levels. It will lower the inventories and working capital, reduce documentation, improve asset utilisation, ensure higher turnaround time and efficiencies. We expect the industry to move away from pure vanilla warehousing needs to contract logistics,” Prakash Tulsiani, Executive Director & COO, Allcargo Logistics, tells The Dollar Business. EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, A REALITY! CENTRAL TAXES SUBSUMED UNDER GST Central Excise Duty (including additional excise duties) Service Tax Additional Customs Duty (CVD) Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD) Central Sales Tax and cesses STATE GOVERNMENT TAXES SUBSUMED UNDER GST Value Added Tax Sales Tax Octroi and Entry Tax Purchase Tax Luxury Tax Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling State cesses and surcharges Entertainment Tax IMPACT OF GST ON BUSINESSES Sourcing : Inter-state procurement will become easier;Manufacturers get the option of consolidating supplies from vendors;Additional Duty/CVD and Special Additional Duty components of Customs Duty to be subsumed. Distribution : The new regime will allow consolidation and optimisation of warehouses;Current arrangements for distribution of finished goods to change;Current network structure and product flows may need review and possible alteration because of removal of Excise Duty. Pricing and profitability : Tax changes resulting from the GST structure would require repricing of Products. Prices could both increase or decrease; Margins or price mark-ups would also need to be re-examined. Cash flow: Removal of the concept of Excise Duty on manufacturing can result in improvement in cash flows and inventory costs as GST would now be paid at the time of sale/supply rather than at the time or removal of goods from the factory. System changes and transaction management: Potential changes to accounting and IT systems in areas of master data, supply chain transactions, system design;Existing open transactions and balances as on the cut-off date need to be migrated out to ensure smooth transition to GST;Changes to supply chain reports (e.g., purchase register, sales register,services register), other tax reports and forms (e.g., invoices,purchase orders) need review;Appropriate measures such as training of employees, compliance under GST, customer education and tracking of inventory credit are needed to ensure smooth transition to the GST regime. DUAL-GST: WHO GETS WHAT TRANSACTION NEW SYSTEM OLD SYSTEM COMMENTS Sales within the state State GST & Central GST VAT & Excise / ST Under the new system, a transaction of sale within the state shall attract two taxes: SGST (which goes to the State), and CGST (which goes to the Centre) Sales outside the state Integrated GST CST & Excise / ST Under the new system, a transaction of sale from one state to another shall have only one type of tax, the IGST – which is collected by the Centre NOT SO EASY Sounds good. But then it won’t be an easy run to the finish line for GST. And the reason is simple! The dual nature of India’s GST regime is expected to make implementation a complex problem, and rob off some of the key features of ease of doing business. Canada and Brazil, both have a federal administrative structure similar to that of India and have opted for the dual GST route. For instance in Canada, the dual GST route obviously cleared up the conflict between states and the Union government in terms of revenue generation and tax collection, and allowed for a consensus to be formed. But then, Canada owing to the dual nature of its GST has not been able to unify the nation as a common market, with different taxes in different provinces still in effect. In India, though the scrapping of the proposed additional 1% inter-state tax has cleared the air considerably making businesses happy, the states still need to agree on a common rate. And while states like West Bengal and Bihar will be happy with a low tax rate, many like Tamil Nadu are expected to ask for a much higher rate. At the high-end, some states have even asked for a GST rate of 27%. But then, experts believe, a tax rate that high can completely negate the positive effects of GST. “The current combined Centre and state statutory rate for majority of the commodities works out to be 26.5% (CENVAT : 14%, and VAT: 12.5%). Once GST is implemented, the same is expected to reduce to a standard rate to about 18-21%. This will naturally be beneficial for the end users. But if the tax rate goes beyond 18-21%, a lot of the benefits of GST will be lost,” says Harpreet Singh Malhotra, Chairman & Managing Director, Tiger Logistics. And then there is the issue of tax refunds from state governments, with some states known to be tardy with refunds. Rakesh Shah, Director, Nipha Group, a Kolkata-based exporter of engineering goods, while speaking to The Dollar Business on the dual-GST sytem says, “This is the biggest drawback of the GST regime from our perspective. Some state governments do not have a great track record of refunding taxes and there is nothing in GST so far that makes us believe that they will change their behaviours.” There is another fear – inflation. THE INFLATION BOOGIE The proposed tax regime has raised fears of inflation at a time when CPI has shot up beyond the official tolerance level of 6%. Outgoing RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has cautioned the industry that there could be a generalised inflationary effect on the economy due to price adjustments after implementation of GST. However, the Governor has also clarified that he expects the inflationary pressure to be negligible. Citing the example of Malaysia, he said that the inflation in Malaysia was both negligible and short-lived and this is expected in India as well due to a one-time price adjustment of goods and services. Potential inflation will depend significantly on the final rate of GST and the basket of goods and services that will be exempt from GST. Meanwhile, RBI Deputy Governor Urjit Patel has pointed out that about 55% of the items that form the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be exempt from GST, making the inflationary impact negligible. Even a Nomura report estimates GST to impact headline CPI inflation by just 20-70 basis points (bps) and core CPI by 10-40 bps in the first year of implementation. And that would exbe on account of higher prices of electricity, clothing and footwear, healthcare, medicine, and education after accounting for input taxes. Food items like cereals and vegetables are expected to become more expensive. Essential items like health services and medicines will also become expensive as they presently are subjected to lower tax rates, even if GST rate is capped at 18%.As of now, products like alcohol and petroleum have been kept out the GST ambit; clarity is yet to emerge on whether there will be more exemptions. With various industry bodies lobbying for exemptions or lower rates, it is plausible that we will see more products and services being exempted. That being said, in the past, countries (like Malaysia and New Zealand) which have opted for GST have been known to face high inflation and slowdown in consumption initially.Whether history will be repeated in India depends on a host of factors, the most important being the standard rate of GST finally agreed upon. EXPORTS TO CLIMB? If GST improves ease of doing business, can exports be far behind? With uniform taxation and cost efficiencies owing to reduced time and costs in transportation, one obvious effect would be that ‘Made in India’ products would now be more cost competitive in the global markets. “In the previous tax regime, our exbe ports were sagging, since we also exported a major portion of taxes. Indigenous manufacturers failed to capitalise owing to double taxation. All this will change post GST. And eventually exports from the country will increase,” says Nihal Kothari, Chairman, National Council on Indirect Taxes, ASSOCHAM and Executive Director at Khaitan & Co. And he is right! We have examples of GST boosting an economy’s exports. For instance, New Zealand implemented GST in CY1986 and saw it exports jump from $5,880 million in CY1986 to $7,195 million CY1987, a growth of 22.36%. Similar was the case with Australia, which implemented GST regime in CY2000. Australia’s exports grew at a CAGR of 7.9% from $63,870 million in CY2000 to $86,565 million in CY2004.The present system of differential multiple tax regimes across sectors of production and locations leads to distortions in allocation of resources as well as supply chain and warehouse structuring. There is a tendency of manufacturers to locate manufacturing facilities as well as warehouses in states or locations that offer better tax structures regardless of their suitability in terms of other resources. With regard to India’s exports, this leads to lack of international competitiveness of the sectors which would have been relatively efficient under distortion-free indirect tax regime. Add to this, there is a lack of full offsets of taxes loaded on to the FOB (Free On Board) export prices. This results in export competitiveness further getting negatively impacted. Efficient allocation of productive resources and providing full tax offsets, as envisaged under the GST, is therefore expected to result in gains for exporters. According to a paper on GST by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) submitted to the 13th Finance Commission, gains in exports are expected to vary between 3.2% and 6.3% (while imports are expected to rise somewhere between 2.4% and 4.7%). Sectors which are expected to see a substantial increase in exports include textiles and readymade garments, beverages, industrial machinery for food and textiles, transport equipment other than railway equipment, electrical and electronic machinery, and chemical products. Further, while agricultural machinery, metals and railway transport equipment are expected to gain moderately, exports is expected to decline when it comes to agricultural commodities, iron and steel, cement, wood and wood products except furniture. GST will provide the much-needed boost to India’s automotive industry, primarily because of the removal of cascading that is expected with the new tax regime. (Image Source: The Dollar Business) FATE OF FTP SCHEMES A mixed bag of good and bad news could therefore be on offer for India’s exporters.And it will be that way with some sectors emerging as winners, while others losing out on a few advantages. However, what can be a bigger cause of worry for exporters is the ambiguity with respect to various export promotion schemes allowed by India’s Foreign Trade Policy (like MEIS, SEIS, EPCG, DBK, Advance Authorisation, etc.) during the initial GST implementation phase. Exporters are allowed to claim refunds on Central Excise, Customs duties and Service Tax against various scrips issued by the Ministry of Commerce. Since Central Excise and Service Tax will be subsumed under GST, exporters may face problems in encashing the much-needed incentives that have been structured to support exports.Asks Shah of Nipha Group, “Exports are zero rated, but GST retains the refund system at the final stage which will mean increased blockage of funds. A number of current export promotion schemes will wither away or get diluted. Similarly, what will happen to our dues during the transition from the current system to GST? How will they be treated?” Office of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Ministry of Commerce, GoI, is aware of the issue. D. K. Singh, Additional DGFT, while speaking to The Dollar Business says, “Under the current system, one can pay Customs Duty, Central Excise Duty and Service Tax. But, since Central Excise will be replaced by other taxes such as IGST and SGST under GST, it may not be a smooth transition for our exporters. So, we have requested the Finance Ministry to reconsider and allow us to maintain the scrip.” As per him, the matter is currently under examination by the Ministry of Finance. The current indirect tax regime provides for lower or no Customs Duty on imports for importers who use those imports in producing goods that are subsequently exported. However, under GST, imports would be subject to IGST (CGST plus SGST) and any exemptions or additional levy will not exist. This would provide level-playing field to domestic manufacturers against importers. In case of special economic zone (SEZs), the various exemptions provided under different schemes would be limited in their applicability to export duty only. Exports or deemed exports would be zero rated, but sale to domestic tariff area (DTA) would be taxable. Exports from these special zones though will get a leg-up by being more cost competitive, owing to reduced logistics costs. ON THE FAST LANE GST has the potential to revolutionise the logistics industry. India’s trucking and logistics sector will realise its worth once GST is implemented at the ground level. Experts believe that the tax procedure will get reduced dramatically and the cost of holding inventory will fall by 50%, since stock would no longer need to be piled up in various warehouses. Analysts estimate that the logistics sector will witness up to $200 billion in savings annually with GST, thanks to faster movement of goods and minimum idling, which have troubled the industry for long now. Explaining the issue of idling, Harpreet Singh Malhotra, CMD, Tiger Logistics says, “Prolonged delays at toll booths and extra fuel usage due to regular idling were resulting in annual losses of more than Rs.1,00,000 crore. Such delays don’t just burn money, they slow down business too.” According to Malhotra, while trucks in US are said to cover a distance of 800 km every day, in India they cover only 280 km a day. There is no surprise in the fact, because where average US truck speeds exceed 89 kmper hour on highways, 12.7 km per hour is considered good as long-distance average in India. “Once GST gets going, these challenges will become a thing of the past,” adds Ramesh Agarwal, CMD, Agarwal Movers Group. According to logistics experts, the Indian logistics industry spends around 14% of the GDP every year on different types of cost incurred in logistics operations.The amount of cost incurred is very high in comparison to the logistics cost incurred in different nations. This scenario is expected to change once GST is in place. In fact, 3PL logistics market in India is expected to be worth $301.89 billion by 2020. This growth is based on expectations that GST will soon be implemented and logistics companies can optimise their operations to reduce cost and increase margins. RAVI RAMU MD & CEO,VBHC Value Homes “Affordable housing requires an ease of doing business for both the builder and the buyer. GST is a giant leap in this direction. We are delighted at the prospect of dealing with easily understood and implementable indirect tax laws. The marginally higher incidence of indirect taxes through the introduction of GST, if any, will be more than compensated for by the savings in time and effort in operating a far simpler law.” “GST will convert a diversified tax regime into one uniform tax rate making India a single market place. This would facilitate seamless transportation of goods across borders with a significantly lower transit time, thereby stepping up demand for logistics services.The GST Bill will also lead to higher vehicle capacity utilisation resulting in increased efficiencies at every node of the logistics ecosystem. Overall, this is a positive move that will generate growth opportunities for organised players within the logistics industry,” says Abhishek Chakraborty, Executive Director, DTDC Express Limited. Apart from simplifying the tax structure, GST will bring in huge relief to several players at the operational level as they can now do away with fixed costs of maintaining warehousing across various locations in India. “The fixed warehousing overheads of companies across industries will decrease by 30-32% and that will make them more competitive in the international market. Portable and virtual warehousing will become a viable option for many companies. It will also enhance their operational efficiency,” says Agarwal of Agarwal Movers Group. Although various logistics players and experts are expecting a short-term inflationary impact on exports, consensus is that GST will, in the long run, increase competitiveness of Indian exporters. IN AN AUTO MODE India’s automobile exports contracted 9.7% during the first quarter of this fiscal, with shipments of three-wheelers nose-diving as much as 46.6%. Last year, however, overall exports from the sector grew marginally at 1.91% over the previous fiscal, with commercial vehicle segment leading the exports growth. Come today, the automobile industry seems to be thrilled with the notion of a simplified tax regime. “The current tax structure on automobiles is riddled with complexities,” says Vivek Mishra, Partner & National Leader – Indirect Tax, PricewaterhouseCoopers. HOW GST WILL WORK: AN EXAMPLE (SMALL CAR) CURRENT GST Manufactures’ price (Rs.) 3,00,000 3,00,000 Total taxes at manufacturing stage (*includes excise duty, infra cess, VAT, octroi) 1,41,690 (47.23% total tax)* 54,000 (18% GST) Cost to dealers 4,41,690 3,54,000 Margin @10% 44169 35,400 Sale price for dealers 4,85,859 3,89,400 VAT/GST 60732 (12.5%) 70,092 (18%) Net VAT/GST (after claiming credit) 12,558 16,092 Price to retail customers 5,46,590 4,59,493 Currently, automobile sales are subject to six different types of tax at various rates which include Excise Duty, Infrastructure Cess, Octroi, VAT, Motor Vehicle Tax/Road Tax and Tax Collected at Source (TCS). What’s more? The variation in each of these tax rates, according to vehicle type, engine size and ground clearance, further compounds complexities. GST, once implemented, will remove the cascading effect of taxes and put Indian automobile industry on a stronger growth trajectory. All taxes on input paid will also be offset with the output liability of GST. Owing to different types of indirect taxes collected by the Centre and States separately, taxes paid on some of the input costs currently cannot be set-off against the final tax. Some of the common examples include Service Tax paid on certain inputs such as rent, IT, freight, etc., and lower tax credit on outsourcing activities, etc. This is likely to change once GST is implemented. Further, since CST will be subsumed in GST, manufacturers will no longer be required to have warehouses at multiple locations across states. The 2% CST, which currently is a cost to the manufacturer, will become a part of IGST, and the manufacturers will not be liable to pay this origin tax. Under the current regime, Excise Duty on vehicles is categorised into four slabs, in which smallest duty is applicable on smaller cars. But within the GST framework, taxes levied by the Central government such as Excise Duty and by state governments as Sales Tax would be subsumed into one tax uniform tax. If the proposed tax rate of 18-20% is approved, the prices of vehicle are expected to decrease by almost 8-18%, and a reduction in automobile cost structure will not only fuel demand for automobiles in the domestic market but will also make India-made vehicles more cost-competitive in export markets. The industry expects a dual tax structure for small and big cars to be announced when the government is ready with the final GST laws. “According to a report by the Committee on Economic Affairs, the proposed GST rate on SUVs is 40%. Therefore, SUV prices may increase slightly. But for all other cars, there will be a significant reduction in rates,” says Mishra. The current indirect tax provision categorises cars into four segments, with all attracting different sets of tax rates. While small cars (less than 1200 cc) attract a total of 27.6% tax (Excise Duty 12.50% + Cess 1.1 % + VAT 14%), medium cars (1200 cc – 1500 cc) attract 39.1% tax (Excise Duty 24% + Cess 1.1 % + VAT 14%). Luxury cars (beyond 1500 cc) and SUVs (also beyond 1500 cc), on the other hand, attract 42.1% (Excise 27% + Cess 1.1 % + VAT 14%) and 45.1% (Excise Duty 30% + Cess 1.1 % + VAT 14%) respectively. Therefore, cars manufacturers end up paying tax in the rage of 27.6% (minimum) to 45.1% (maximum). If the proposed GST rate of 18-20% is accepted, small as well as big cars, excluding SUVs for which 40% rate has been discussed, will become cheaper and fuel the growth of the auto industry. While the automobile industry is betting big on the new indirect tax regime, it has apprehensions over the tax rate. How will the new rates be decided? Will there be a uniform rate for all size of cars? Will they all fall under the same 18-20% tax rate bracket? The question seems to be more about whether the government will decide rates based on efficiency or the capacity of cars. Nevertheless, if the industry’s predictions are anything to go by, automobile exports will be a major gainer from the new tax arrangement. The GST will help relax the burden of double taxation, unravel complexities and enhance ease of doing business for export-oriented automobile manufacturing hubs. However, the major challenge for the exporters will be to effectively manage their cash flow amid this shift from an exemption-based tax system to a refund-based system. The GST system would also encourage Indian vehicle manufacturers to produce cars of international standards. Under the current regime, a manufacturer has to comply with a labyrinth of taxes, which act as huge hurdles and add costs at each stage. Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in India, primarily becauseof the country’s regulatory and bureaucratic complexities. In the absence of GST, not only Indian car-makers but foreign too have to waste energy in their operations. A successful enactment of the new indirect tax regime would have a transformative effect on FDI in India. GST will also lessen overall production cost and hassles, thereby encouraging domestic as well as international car manufacturers to expand their businesses and make Indian products more qualitative and competitive across the world.A very similar situation is applicable to the engineering and capital goods manufacturing sectors. VINEET BAID CEO, Falcon Autotech “It is certain for businesses to welcome the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill. Businesses will now re-design the supply chains for removing the taxation bias from the supply chain design.This reshaping of supply chains by other sectors is set to favour the logistics sector by thus creating multiple opportunities. Consequently, we anticipate a sharp increase in the demand for warehouse automation, larger warehouses, high tonnage trucks and logistics management software. Supply chain consultants will see high demand for network planning and optimisation projects.Overall, we are expecting to see organized warehousing to witness significant upsurge.” ENGINEERED SUCCESS According to a Care Ratings report, “the complexity in the Engineering Goods sector is that companies are involved simultaneously in manufacturing of goods and rendering of services. For example, a company engaged in manufacturing of transmission towers also does EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction Services) of entire transmission lines which not only involves manufacturing of transmission towers but supply of bought out items and rendering of services. The EPC players pay service tax at present while the manufacturers pay excise duty. Introduction of GST is expected to improve the prospects of engineering, capital goods and power equipment (ECPE) sector by simplifying the tax structure.” And not to say the industry too has embraced the GST regime with both hands and hopes that it will transform the sector. Arvinder Pal Singh, Owner of Perfect Vibrator Company, a Delhi-based manufacturer of construction machinery parts, says, “GST is good for our industry. GST needs to be implemented as there would be a common tax. If there is one tax system, it will help in setting up the company anywhere in the country and also facilitates ease of doing business.” B. Ashok Rao of Rajeev & Co, manufacturer and exporter of ball valves, holds similar views. “GST will help in bringing down the cost of production in manufacturing of goods. The major advantage is that it facilitates inter-state trading which was earlier quite cumbersome due to various levies at different levels and in different states.” Players in the engineering sector are proposing that the tax rate under GST regime should be kept at a minimum level as it will result in lowering the final cost of products. “Tax rate should be 18% as it will benefit the industry in keeping the cost of production low and in turn passing the benefit to customers in form of lower-priced product. The proposed 22-25% tax structure would be too high for the industry,” says Singh. Rao also supports the 18% tax rate adding that “there is no direct benefit of GST on exports but lower costs at manufacturing level can automatically promote trade at both national as well as international levels.” The engineering sector, being the largest of the industrial sectors in India, is of strategic importance to the economy owing to its strong integration with other sectors. And as such it plays a pivotal role in the development of other industrial sectors of the economy. In fact, today, engineering sector accounts for about a quarter of the total factories and more than half of the overall foreign collaborations in the country. Hence, the proposed tax rate and structure under GST for the industry should be such that it avoids procedural difficulties for exporters and make their products competitive in export markets. “Instead of first paying the taxes and then claiming credit for the same, the proposed enabling GST law should exempt exporters from the taxation net since the country does not want to export taxes,” says T. S. Bhasin, Chairman, Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC). As per Bhasin, the turnaround time for tax return processing needs to be sped up tremendously. “Even if we consider six months on average, engineering goods companies will require a huge additional working capital,” he says. Further, post GST, buyers too will have to ensure that their vendors have robust IT infrastructure and compliance process in place, so that vendors do not default on timely and appropriate payment of taxes. RIGHT MEDICINE When it comes to pharmaceuticals sector, another key foreign exchange earner for the country, the reaction to the passage of the Bill has been mostly positive.GST will not only simplify tax structure, but will also create a level-playing field for Indian pharmaceutical companies vis-à-vis foreign competition. “The biggest advantage to the industry would be that of reduction in transaction cost, with an immediate impact coming from the discontinuance of CST. The multistage taxation along with the inability to take full benefit of the CENVAT credit / refund has been an issue for the industry. With central GST expected to be a single rate for goods and services, going forward credit accumulation may not be an area of concern,” states the report from Care Ratings. Furthermore, if the legislation provides for carrying forward of the unutilised credit this would be an additional boost to the industry. However, there are concerns about drug prices, exemptions and compliance procedures. Some analysts have warned that there could be a mild inflationary impact of GST on prices of medicines over the next one-two years. “Currently, medicines are taxed at 5% to 7.5%, depending on the state they are being sold. Post GST, our tax liability will increase to 12%. This will put further financial burden on our customers,” believes Rahul Thakral, MD, Biotic Healthcare. Terming inverted duty structure “the biggest challenge” for the sector, Kanchana T. K., Director General, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), says, “inputs are taxed at 12.5% currently, while finished formulations are taxed at 6% from a Central Excise Duty standpoint. The difference is accumulated as a value-added tax credit (CENVAT), but no provision exists for refunds against accumulated CENVAT credits. The process of getting refunds under state VAT rules (where they exist) is also a long one.” However, suggesting a way out, Kanchana adds, “Specifically notifying the pharmaceutical industry under the model GST law and making the process of refund easier by automating it, would make a huge difference to drug manufacturers.” Well, a big first step in this direction is the provision in the draft GST which allows refunds in cases where the GST rate on inputs is higher than the GST rate on outputs. Some industry experts even forecast a possibility of negative impact on pharma sector if rate exceeds 12% because, as per them, the impact on pharma is largely rate-dependent. Similar concerns are echoed by Thakral of Biotic Healthcare who envisage a rate range hovering somewhere between 10-12% to be optimal. “Anything beyond, will negatively impact pharma industry,” he says. NO SHINY GEM FOR ALL Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his speech post passage of the Bill in Parliament, described GST as one more pearl in India’s necklace. The metaphor may be apt when it comes to overall tax reforms, but India’s gems and jewellery industry is, however, circumspect about GST’s glitter. Almost all major stakeholders in the exports segment want the government to levy the minimum possible tax rate on the industry under GST. The concept of Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR, a tax rate that allows the government to receive the same amount of money despite of changes in tax laws) is at the heart of the debate on calculating ATUL BANSHAL President, Finance and Accounts, M3M Group GST appears to be a benefactor for the real estate regime, primarily in light of the expected free flow of credit, which should translate into an increase in margins in the hands of the developer. Seamless and uniform transaction across states will help in cost rationalisation. GST should have a significant impact for commercial property developers, who today are burdened with high costs in absence of credit availability on construction services used for developing a to-be-rented commercial property. It is expected that under the GST regime, there should be a smooth flow of credit and current restriction on construction related credits not being available for offset is expected to be removed. This would help reduce the project costs in the hands of the developer, which should further have a positive effect on rentals. If the credit restrictions continue, due to higher GST rates, the project cost are only going to get escalated further. Besides, it also appears beneficial to end-user or buyers. Uniformity in taxes will help the buyers as well. In the current scenario, several taxes are added up in the cost posing a great difficulty for an ordinary buyer. Implementation of GST will lead to uniformity in taxation rescuing an ordinary buyer from calculation traps designed by the statute. the acceptable and feasible GST rate for the gems and jewellery industry and other industries for that matter. In fact, the government had published a report on RNR and the structure of rates for GST, prepared by a committee chaired by Chief Economic Advisor Dr.Arvind Subramanian in December 2015. A survey was then carried out by the National Sample Survey Organisation, based on the report. The survey found that the tax structure for the gems and jewellery industry had been formulated at a ubsidised rate and, as a result of that, other industries are paying a price. In a nutshell, the survey findings were not in favour of the gems and jewellery industry. And the chances are high that incidence of tax on the industry will increase once GST is implemented. Well, the industry is crying fowl over the findings! According to Sanjeev Agarwal, CEO, Gitanjali Exports, one of the key objectives of the survey was to ascertain luxury and non-luxury product categories and, unfortunately, while doing so, the survey categorised gold as a luxury product. “In my opinion, the analysis is flawed for some obvious reasons. For instance, there is a possibility that households with low or no literacy level might not have understood the significance of the survey and ended up providing inaccurate gold investment details which might have had an adverse effect on the outcome of the survey,” says Agarwal. For telecom companies, the incidence of taxes will increase post-GST. (Image Source: The Dollar Business) Moreover, as per Agarwal, the survey didn’t differentiate between rural households and households that are dependent on the agrarian economy. “The distinction is crucial given the fact that agrarian economy enjoys substantial tax benefits,” says Agarwal. In fact, a huge share of earnings in the agrarian sector is beyond the ambit of tax-net. In addition, the penetration is gold is higher than the penetration of bank savings account in the country, which inevitably, makes gold, an unofficial currency in the rural areas. So, the survey inference that says that gold is being heavily subsidized and benefits are accrued to the rich and wealthy is inappropriate, feel industry insiders. In fact, the industry is unequivocal in its demand that GST should be levied at the lower slab. Gems and Jewellery Exports Promotion Council (GJEPC) has already submitted a preliminary report prepared by a Mumbai-based law firm, Economic Law Practice (ELP), after gathering feedback from various manufacturing segments of the industry like plain gold, diamonds and coloured gemstones. “Our key concerns are that supply and manufacturing side should not be overburdened with taxes, and getting tax input credit refund should be smooth. Above all, our exports should remain competitive, given the current global scenario,” says Sabyasachi Ray, Executive Director, GJEPC. One shouldn’t forget that there are past instances of higher tax structures proving detrimental to the country in more ways than one. For instance, the 10% import duty on gold, although succeeded in reducing gold import through official channel, it has also encouraged smuggling of gold inadvertently. According to various estimates, almost 200 tonne of gold worth Rs.60,000 crore is smuggled into the country every year. WEAVING MAGIC? Textile is another industry on which GST might have a negative impact. While the final GST rates are yet to be announced, even at the 12% lower rate recommended by the Dr. Arvind Subramanian Committee, the textile sector is likely to be negatively impacted. In fact, the cotton value chain is likely to be the worst affected as it is currently attracting zero Central Excise Duty. What’s more? Industry rating agency ICRA expects that “due to reduced tax advantage of cotton yarn vis-a-vis manmade yarn, there can be a gradual shift in the domestic textile industry towards manmade fibre.” For the uninitiated, India currently operates with a fibre mix of cotton: manmade of 60:40, as against global average ofof 40:60. “However, the degree of impact will depend on the final rates which will be applicable to the sector,” states the report. But then, there are some positives as well. “GST will give a fillip to the outsourcing processes in textile industry. It will translate to administrative ease and can help in significantly curtailing discrepancies and aberrations in the taxation system. Corruption and black money laundering will also be curbed,” says K. K. Lalpuria, Executive Director, Indo Count Industries Ltd., a company engaged in the manufacturing and export of cotton yarn, grey knitted fabrics and cotton made ups. Further, with input tax credit chain becoming more transparent and integrated, the tax credit for exporters will become easier and full credit of indirect taxes can be claimed. But at the same time, the Duty Drawback scheme, which aims to provide credit of indirect taxes, will lose relevance under GST. While export products, where the current duty drawback rates are lower than the incidence on indirect taxes on inputs, will benefit under GST, sectors, where drawback rates are higher, will take a hit in profitability. NOT BANKING ON GST One sector that has viewed GST skeptically is the services sector. “There could be a decrease in consumption of services as the service tax will move northward from the current rate of 15%,” says Saravana Kumar, Chief Investment Officer, LIC Nomura Mutual Fund. For instance, tax rates for telecom service providers could move up to 18-22% from the current 15%, resulting a dip in profits. This increased tax could also pinch consumers at the bottom of the pyramid. Further, GST is also being viewed by some as a “landmine of compliance”.Service providers will have to file over 30 returns every month based on their operations and geographic spread. There could also be issues on bringing credits under IGST. A case in point could be a transaction involving a Mumbai resident using Vodafone telecom services travelling to Bengaluru and making calls through an Aircel network. It remains difficult to determine and calculate the importer and supplier in such complicated transactions. Telecom service providers could also have challenges defining interchange costs (the amount that a telco pays a receiving network), besides finding it restrictive to market free and bundled services. The GST Bill is also leading CFOs of banks and financial corporations to ponder on the nature of business and areas that could be potentially hit. “For banks, the challenge could be further complicated as they may be construed as e-com operators for facilitating supply of services or goods through an electronic platform. This will result in an added obligation to collect tax at source. Under the present regime, there already exists litigation on whether banks or NBFCs are liable to pay taxes as dealers,” says Nihal Kothari, Chairman – National Council of Indirect Taxes, ASSOCHAM. Even IT companies are wary of the GST. Some feel the proposed tax regime could lower the competitiveness of India’s IT sector. “Companies engaged in the supply of services on a pan-India basis, will have to seek registrations in 37 jurisdictions. Complex billing and invoicing requirements due to place of supply and valuation will hit the service sector hard in general and IT in particular,” says R. Chandrashekha, President, National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom). HURDLES GALORE Well, GST comes with its own set of challenges. For most companies, overhauling the entire IT systems is the biggest challenge and this process could take anything between 6 to 9 months. While the government issued the first draft model GST law over a month ago, further details are awaited on aspects relating to compliance such as invoice formats and return details. “We anticipate several teething problems in transitioning to the GST regime. In the initial months, we anticipate that a parallel system for undertaking compliance will be required. The complexities are far more for services companies, where a lot of ground needs to be covered to get clarity on taxation of pan India contracts involving multiple states,” says Mahesh Jaising, Partner, BMR & Associates LLP, a tax advisory firm. Companies are even hiring experts to help them make a smooth transition from current tax regime to GST. For instance, FMCG major Emami has hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess the impact of GST regime on the company and chart a roadmap to realign company’s strategy accordingly. “Migrations from current regime to GSTN (Goods and Services Tax Network) will start from October 1, 2016,” says L. Badri Narayanan, Partner, Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan. Narayanan’s firm is an advisor to Infosys, the system integrator in the GST project. He shares that most suppliers’ data will be transitioned from Excise, Central Sales and VAT to GSTN, however, suppliers will have to request for registration for migrating to ISD (Input Service Distributor). WHILE THE BILL HAS BEEN EMBRACED, ITS SUCCESS WILL BE DEFINED BY ITS IMPLEMENTATION While most legal experts sound optimistic that the system will be operational by end of 2017, industry and technology experts opine that building a system from legacy could have potential barriers. Narayanan is hopeful that the GST network will be ready and operational by April 1, 2017, but the transition period could result in working capital issues for traders. “A trader is neither manufacturing nor providing services, and if he is not eligible for CENVAT credit within the old regime he will not be entitled to CENVAT credit on duty paid which he earlier received,” he explains. A major change involving GST implementation is its compliance, which will necessitate robust systems and tracking of information. Since the entire process of tax has been revamped, the process of accounting and auditing will also undergo a change. Much of this change will occur on the systems that organisations use for compliance. “Entire ERP systems will need to be re-configured, and staff will have to be trained on GST aspects. The onboarding of vendors could result in a big change. There is need of support from finance, procurement, legal, IT, and many other departments for positive outcome of GST, else the holistic picture may not be possible,” says Pratik Shah, Partner, SKP Business Consulting LLP. As manufacturing becomes advantageous, organisations will be motivated to manufacture commodities themselves rather than procuring them. For service organisations, they will be compelled to think on operating back-office centres themselves. On the positive side, from the government’s perspective, GST systems across the globe have improved compliance, and in many-an-instance we’ve seen even a revenue neutral rate turning into revenue positive due to an expanded tax base. Thus far, Indian exporter-manufacturers were at a huge disadvantage due to overlapping taxes. But with GST, hope is, matters will change for the better. (Image Source: The Dollar Business) MORE GOOD THAN BAD? The successful implementation of GST will depend on its smooth passage in the states, and the formation of a GST council that drives consensus on rates, exclusion lists, applicability limits, principles of supply, special provisions to certain states, and a host of other rules and regulations. Even the time chosen for implementation will matter a lot when it comes to confusion and litigations. “Full-fledged IT system should be in place so that there is no dispute in arriving at the losses incurred by states in the first five years. An April 1, 2017 rollout may affect the last quarter business of FY2017. Hence, implementation during mid 2017-18 would be ideal and preferable,” says Ashok P. Hinduja, Chairman, Hinduja Group of Companies. Whatever be the implementation hassles and timeframe, the fact remains GST is a big step towards making India a unified market. The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set-off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax (CST) will not only reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services, but will also increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. That by our count is more good than bad. Note: This article was Originally Published in The Dollar Business by TDB INTELLIGENCE UNIT September, 2016 ?

13," Will GST help GDP growth? | Business Line Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy COMMENT Will GST help GDP growth? Lokeshwarri SK BL Research Bureau · print · T+ · T- Tweet Final standard GST rate, exemptions granted, compensations to States will determine the actual benefit to the economy August 4, 2016: Adi Godrej, the most forceful proponent of GST, thinks that the GDP growth rate will soon be in double digit with the unified tax system. A study done by NCAER that explores the impact on growth due to reduction in direct cost and cost reduction on capital inputs pegged the improvement in growth rates between 2 and 2.5 per cent. Others have estimated the Indian economic growth between 1.5 and 2 per cent faster under the new tax regime. While these projections can come true over the long-term, it is doubtful if there will be an immediate improvement in the growth rate of the economy. In fact, growth can slow down in the initial phase of the GST roll-out before the longer term benefits kick-in. Negative impact in the short term The primary reason why growth can be affected, at least in the first year, will be because the tax on services that account for around 60 per cent of the GDP, is expected to increase under GST while taxes on manufactured products that make up 17 per cent of the GDP can move lower. There is a typical tendency to prepone consumption if taxes are expected to move higher. But in this case, since most services are non-discretionary and since tax rates on goods can move lower, output can contract slightly following the roll-out. A panel regression analysis done by Sonal Verma and Neha Saraf of Nomura on 11 countries for the period between 1961-2015 to study the impact of change in effective tax rate shows that for countries where tax rates moved higher, GDP growth picks up in the year prior to the GST implementation (year T-1), likely reflecting preponement of consumption in anticipation of higher prices. “This is followed by a temporary (though insignificant) negative impact on GDP growth due to weaker consumption in the year T, as firms pass on tax increases into higher output prices. Beyond that, growth does rebound, perhaps due to efficiency gains from a more streamlined tax structure and better tax compliance.” However, there is a consensus among most economists that the GST will be positive for the economy over the longer term as it simplifies the tax structure, increasing compliance, reduces tax evasion, expands tax base and significantly improves the functioning of the logistics network. Expansion of tax base The GST regime ensures that the tax base for indirect taxes grows through two ways. One, it sets up a system of taking credit for taxes on inputs only if it has been declared and paid by the input manufacturer. This sets up a system of self-policing as it is in the interest of the producer to ensure that he sources goods only from those suppliers who are tax-compliant. Many companies in the unorganised sector who are currently not paying tax are thus expected to fall within the tax net. Two, the committee set up to recommend the Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) under Arvind Subramaniam, recommended an exemption threshold of Rs 25 lakh for goods. Currently, goods producers with turnover less than Rs 1.5 crore are exempted from paying central excise duties; at the state level, the exemption limit for goods varies between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. Decreasing the threshold for GST will therefore make many small manufacturers liable to pay tax on their products. Corporate tax data shows that entities recording revenue between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 40 lakh are paying a very small proportion of tax, though they are large in number. The threshold for services will however increase from the current limit of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 25 lakh. Investments-kicker The RNR report submitted in December 2015 makes the point that investments in the economy will improve “with a more seamless and efficient crediting of taxes paid on capital goods.” Currently, companies sourcing capital goods for capacity expansion cannot claim tax credit on capital goods purchased; this will change with the GST regime. The report says that capital goods prices would become effectively 12-14 per cent cheaper as companies avail tax credit. This is likely to increase investments and help growth. The report says that this could lead to incremental GDP of 0.5 per cent. There is a long way to go and many hurdles to surpass before the GST becomes a reality. The final standard GST rate, exemptions granted, compensations to States etc will determine the actual benefit to the economy. It is to be seen if the bonhomie witnessed on Wednesday between the political parties continues to make the GST a reality.

14," Who says GST is beneficial? | Business Line Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Beyond Stocks Macro View Net Worth Real Assets Your Money Firm Calls Mutual Funds Technically People By Invitation Who says GST is beneficial? SAURABH MUKHERJEA · print · T+ · T- Tweet In lower income countries GST has hurt consumption by increasing prices With the NDA seemingly keen to reconvene Parliament in order to procure Rajya Sabha approval for the Constitutional Amendment on the Goods and Services Tax (GST), it is worth trying to understand the economic impact of this misunderstood tax, which seems to have been debated in India for over six years now without the most impacted constituency — the consumer — having a say in the matter. Mixed economic impact Contrary to what the current and previous administrations in New Delhi say, cross-country evidence suggests that the introduction of GST has no correlation whatsoever with GDP growth. Although the introduction of a single GST limits inefficiencies created by a heterogeneous taxation system, there is little evidence that it helps boost economic activity. In developed economies like New Zealand and Australia the introduction of GST does not seem to have hurt economic growth; but in lower income countries like Nigeria and Malaysia, GST does seem to have cramped consumption by increasing the sticker price that the consumer has to pay. This negative impact on consumption then dampens GDP growth. It is, therefore, quite astonishing that in a low-income economy like ours, we have not even heard a murmur of protest from consumer groups with regard to the imposition of GST. Structure is important The introduction of GST will undoubtedly remove inefficiencies. For instance, the problem of double taxation which arises from India’s parallel — State and Central — systems of indirect taxation which, in turn, differ for goods and services. It will simplify the existing indirect tax structure. But the impact on economic growth remains ambiguous. At the Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR) of 18 per cent, the government’s revenue will remain unaffected and hence the government cannot increase expenditure to stimulate growth. However, at a GST of 25 per cent, India’s tax-to-GDP ratio (which at 11 per cent is significantly lower than other emerging Asian economies’ of over 20 per cent) will increase by as much by 1-2 percentage points. If the government spends these increased revenues of around $20-40 billion on capex, then GDP growth is likely to be positively impacted, especially as the fiscal multiplier (around 2.4x for India) comes into play. A further complication is the mooted 1 per cent inter-state tax, supposed to be collected by the Centre and given to producing States. If levied, this can significantly reduce the benefits of moving to a harmonised GST, especially since, unlike the main GST, this 1 per cent is not offsettable (i.e. businesses which pay this 1 per cent will not be able to use this payment to claim tax relief). In this context, it is surprising that corporate India has not raised a hue and cry about this surcharge. Loss to services If GST is set at the RNR of 18 per cent, most goods which currently pay an effective tax rate of around 24 per cent will benefit. Sectors, such as automobiles, FMCG and home-building materials, in particular, will be positively affected. At a rate of 25 per cent, however, most goods will be negatively impacted; however, at this rate government revenue and, hopefully, government spend on hard asset creation will receive a boost and thus drive GDP growth. However, at both rates — 18 per cent and 25 per cent — Services will be negatively impacted, as it is currently taxed at 14 per cent. Services account for nearly 60 per cent of India’s GDP and a steep rise in the sticker price of Services will almost certainly adversely impact consumer spending in India. In the context of listed stocks, the Services sectors that will be most acutely impacted are aviation, media, telecommunication and to some extent Banking & Financial Services. Whilst given the sheer amount of legislative and logistical work that remains to be done, it is unlikely GST will be implemented before April 2017, it is a shame that a complex tax change — whose overall economic impact is ambiguous, impact on consumers is adverse, and beneficial impact on businesses is being curbed by retrograde additional taxes — is not being debated properly either in Parliament or in the media.

However this value added tax namely Goods and Services Tax Bill could not be passed in the mentioned year due to the rift between state and central regarding the bill. At that point of time Congress party along with the several state governments had denied accepting the GST bill as they have shown a lot of loopholes in the bill. In August 2016, finally after couple of years the states, even the Congress party had given a nod to the bill and it gets passed in 3 rd August, Wednesday 2016 in Rajya Sabha. What is GST Bill | GST Meaning Goods and Services Tax Bill is, as mentioned, a type of indirect tax levied on the manufacturing, sales and consumption of any goods and services across India. In India, several state taxes are levied in these three mentioned processes. After GST, there will be only one time tax that will be levied on the goods and services consumed within the boundary of the nation. Central government calls it ‘One nation one tax’ as after passing of the bill suppliers will have to bear onetime indirect tax for their business. Why it is needed? Goods and Services Tax is needed for the reforms of the Indirect tax system in India. As mentioned in the previous paragraph that India does have several taxes in different stages of production and consumption. But under GST there will be one rate of tax that will be borne by the consumer. Considering the consumer’s point of view they will have to pay a much lower rate of taxes than earlier times when it was 25-30%. On the other if the supplier is purchasing the goods and services for general commercial purpose then he / she can claim the tax credit as well. This tax will be an integration of the central as well as state taxes and will become one single tax for one nation. Why State Government opposed it? The state government had opposed the bill at the first place by raising few points against rules and policies regarding the bills. According to the states, the bill does not say anything about the entry tax and the petro tax. The State Empowered Committee Chairman had stated that the bill is not clearly depicting about the fact that if the state undergoes loss of revenue due to levying the GST for the next five years then how the Central will compensate the loss. Even it was not clear that whether they will compensate the revenue loss or not. These factors were the most prominent points that were raised by both the congress and other state governments against the GST Bill. What is the 3 major demand of Congress, due to this it is not supporting GST Bill? Congress had made their points clear when party president Rahul Gandhi spoke about the major demands they had on the bill. He claimed that there were 3 things that they needed to be abolished from the GST Bill. They are: Upper cap on the GST rate: Congress wanted the central government to put a cap on the GST at 18%. However it wasn’t set as Finance Minister of India said putting a cap of 18% would be troublesome under the amendment as each time GST council has to keep on changing the amendment to change the rate. Abolishment of the 1% additional tax: there was a provision of 1% additional tax imposed on the consumption of the goods and services. The party wanted the central to remove it completely to bring down the tax burden. Independent dispute resolution: further the party demanded that the bill must be settled on the independent dispute resolution mechanism which was missing in the original bill proposed by the UPA government. Government point of view towards GST As far as the central government is concerned, they have stated that the tax will amalgamate all the other taxes like purchase tax, entertainment tax, VAT or sales tax, entry tax, excise duty, luxury tax and such and become one tax namely Goods and Services Tax. On the other the state government has taken the GST on a positive way when some of the factors are revised in the bill. The abolishment of 1% additional tax, compensation of the revenue loss for the next years, dispute resolution system for PAN India and accommodated rate of the tax that will bring down the tax burden for common man. Benefits or Positive changes once GST is implemented Once GST will be passed the biggest positive change will be price decrease for several goods and services. Two wheelers and four wheelers price, movie tickets price and finally the domestic product and services price are expected to go down after the bill. For the small cars industry the tax rate will be 18-20% instead of 30.4% so the price will is expected to go down by 10%. Negative changes once GST is implemented As far as the negative changes are concerned, the price of few things are expected to increase, a few of them are Sno Items 1 air tickets for economy 2 air tickets non-economy 3 hotel prices, 4 branded cloths, 5 cigarettes, 6 branded jewellery 7 mobile phone calls 8 online advertisment Currently the tax levied on economy class tickets in flights is 6% and 9% for non-economy class will be taxed at 18-20% after GST. Also in the financial sector, the investments, insurance premium and such will be expensive than earlier time. GST Bill passed date On Wednesday, 3 rd of August 2016 the GST bill has passed in Rajya Sabha. Though it was passed by the Lok Sabha in 2015, but it was hooked in Rajya Sabha for several points. GST Bill Latest News There are some areas where these changes have made after GST imposition. All these figures are average and subjected to be changed.

Joe Hockey has already revealed his hand, saying his white paper is intended to address ""our over-reliance"" on personal income tax and company tax. It's also no surprise that the highly paid economists argue for increases to the GST (""Super tax perks for the wealthy in the gun"", 31/3). Economics 101 tells you that reducing income tax and increasing the GST massively shifts the tax burden from the high- to low-income earners. Someone, and you would think it would be Labor, needs to argue that the tax that should be increased to tackle the revenue shortfall and to stimulate the economy is personal income tax. This achieves a number of significant long-term benefits to the economy. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Illustration: Michael Leunig. Income tax as currently structured is a progressive tax, which means those who have a higher capacity to pay more tax do pay more, while those on lower incomes pay less. Increasing income tax does not have to impact on low-income earners' spending power. They will continue to spend all their net pay on goods and services, which churns the economy and creates jobs. Increasing the GST reduces low-income spending power, which hurts the economy. High-income earners' spending and saving habits won't change, even if top marginal rates are increased. Contrary to Joe Hockey's claims that income tax increases would dampen economic activity, increasing the GST would be far worse. Mike Fajdiga, Beaumaris SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Photo: James Davies How about a budget that hits rich? Wouldn't it be wonderful if our government presented a budget that hit the rich, instead of low-income earners? This is what such a budget would do: abolish tax breaks for big mining, raising $10.5billion; reinstate the price on pollution, raising $18billion; implement the original super profits tax on big mining, raising $18.6billion; impose a $2 per tonne levy on thermal coal exports, raising $1.7billion; reduce tax avoidance by taxing discretionary trusts (excepting farmers) the same as corporations, raising $3.6billion; implement a millionaires tax on incomes over $1million, raising $637million; apply a public insurance levy on the big four banks that are ""too big to fail"", raising $16.8billion; introduce a progressive superannuation tax system, replacing the 15per cent flat rate, to prevent tax loopholes being rorted by the mega-rich, raising $10.16billion. Quite easy, really. Mike Puleston, Brunswick Advertisement Labor's submission is crucial If one thing is to come from this taxation white paper, let us hope it is genuine reform. The last tax review yielded an extra tax or two, but no structural change, and the Coalition in opposition refused to co-operate. A review, especially one about tax, will always invite thousands of submissions from diverse groups. Yet, the most important submission must surely come from the Labor Party. Bipartisanship is crucial to this exercise because, without it, neither party will have an appetite for lasting reform in an election year. Harrison Woollacott, Camberwell Conversations driving me mad When talking – pretending to consult the community on issues – became a ""dialogue"", the overuse of the word drove me mad. The current buzzword is ""conversation"". I counted seven repetitions of the word in one brief actual conversation between a government minister and a radio announcer last week. Please mix it up a bit if you want to retain our interest. Louise Inglis, Carlton North We must stand firm The contention that we must surrender our sovereignty in the face of competition from sharp players such as Singapore and Ireland is based on questionable assumptions (Comment, 31/3). The first is that we must kowtow to foreign investors because they are a ""good thing"". Are they good when they buy up profitable Australian companies, converting them into branch offices? Are they good when they repatriate massive profits without paying much tax? Or when they distort the polity by promoting their interests above those of the Australian people? If we were to harness public funds efficiently through government bond issues, we could do without most of this foreign capital. The second assumption is that if we reduce company tax to zero, then the sharp players will just roll over and cry ""uncle"". No, they will bring out a new inducements to further reward the multinationals for running their tax affairs through these companies. Third is the claim that wages will naturally rise if foreign investment increases. This ignores the fact that wages here are based on the historical Australian ""settlement"", and that with every foreign takeover, pressure grows to reduce our wage levels to the pitiful rates paid in places like China and the US. The way to prosperity and security is through taking control of our economic future, not in surrendering to international opportunism. William Puls, Mentone No pesky witnesses Our government is closing the Nauru detention centre's school after this week, forcing refugee children into lower-standard, inadequate local facilities where some say they will be in fear of their safety. Why? Because it fits that fictitious mantra of ""it's not our responsibility, it's Nauru's"". Also, it means there won't be any pesky Australian teachers to bear witness to what is happening or to ""stir up trouble"" – just like those wrongly accused Save the Children workers (totally exonerated in the Moss report). And, of course, the unspoken hope is that it may help deter desperate asylum seekers by making the place even more of a hell-hole for them and their family. What on earth has happened to Australia's responsibilities to care for those who seek refuge with us, under Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton? And where is Mr Morrison's apology after the Moss report's damning findings? John Boyce, Richmond Public health disaster The behaviour of Shane Warne and the Australian cricketers was, for the alcohol industry, undoubtedly a marketing triumph. At the same time it was a public health disaster. There is ample evidence that three leading methods for the reduction of alcohol-related harm are reducing the promotion, reducing the availability and increasing the price. As an addiction medicine physician, I, along with thousands of colleagues in the healthcare sector, see every day the incredible damage alcohol does to people's lives. No one I work with wants to see alcohol prohibited. But the sooner serious action is taken to further regulate alcohol promotion, the sooner our society will benefit. And, just maybe, it will lead to cultural change, and the cessation of the sort of behaviour we witnessed at the MCG on Sunday. Naham Warhaft, Hawthorn Learn some humility Greg Baum's comment was interesting (""Coarse tongues leave stain on the cup"", 31/3). We Kiwis are proud of our Black Caps, win or lose. It seems Australians put their players down if they lose, which shows up in the aggressive sledging of opponents. After all, they get sledged by their supporters if they lose. Don't blame the players, blame the sickening culture in Aussie sport. Learning to be a humble winner is as important as being a proud loser. We still love you Aussies, despite the sledging. Great game. Well done. Steve Russell, Auckland, NZ Embarrassed by antics As I am an Australian citizen, I would very much like to support our cricket team, but its behaviour is so repulsive, I can't bring myself to do so. Brad Haddin's comments about not being able to handle the ""niceness"" of the NZ team is an indication of the degraded culture that has developed, the weak-mindedness that leads to such excessive incivility. And sledging a player when they have already been dismissed? Since when has kicking a man when he's down been part of the Aussie ethic (oh yes, refugee policy). To use a sporting cliche, our cricketers need to have a good hard look at themselves: when I look at them, I just want to look away, embarrassed. Mike Heald, Ballarat Unsafe workplace? Verbal abuse – ""sledging"" – in any workplace today would at the least result in a reprimand and possible dismissal. So why is it tolerated in cricket? The players are professionals, that is, it is their job, and the cricket oval is their workplace, which means that sledging is a violation of the Work Health and Safety Act. Cricket Australia: as the employer, what are you going to do about what could be construed by some as unlawful behaviour of your staff? James Ogilvie, Kew Oh so revealing That homophobia continues to be rife among men ( The Age , 31/3) tells us a lot about our culture and ourselves. Machismo male culture that dictates ""what a real man"" and, for that matter, ""what a real woman"" are, distorts the beautiful differences of humanity. Ironically, the purveyors of ""hate"" words and behaviours may well be projecting their own uncertainty and fear about their sexuality. My rule of thumb as a social worker/counsellor is that they who have much to say about another are revealing a lot about themselves without being consciously aware of doing so. In other words, it's more about you than the target of that person's unwanted attention. Happy loving, Sean Towner. Jelena Rosic, Mornington Church loss lamentable I find the fire that destroyed St James Church in Brighton lamentable. The destruction of such an historical and visually beautiful edifice is a sad day for all. Our family, over a period of 80 years or more, has had a history of weddings, funerals and baptisms with the church. Beautiful times and sad times. Its visual beauty has been part of the landscape for all creeds to enjoy. Virginia Monahan, Melbourne Groomed by monster My family agree with Rachel Griffiths that it is ""a relief"" the church has gone up in flames. Pickering , the priest, was a monster. The youngest of my three daughters and my youngest, a son, were in the church choir directed by his friend. My son has since died of unnatural causes. I naively thought these people were my friends. In reality I was just being ""groomed"". If the fire was deliberately lit, I cannot condemn the perpetrator. No doubt he was one of Pickering's victims. Name and address supplied Filled with foreboding Julie Landvogt's moving article (Comment, 30/3) should be required reading for all politicians. With a daunting family history of Alzheimer's, I read it with a certain foreboding, knowing she could be describing me in 15 years. Although I have prepared an advanced healthcare directive requesting I not be kept alive under the circumstances in which her mother finds herself, I am painfully aware this document has no legal standing in Victoria. I have consequently spent many sleepless nights trying to work out how I can avoid her mother's fate without having to eventually take matters into my own hands before I am incapable of doing so. I can only live for the day legislators start listening to the majority of Victorians, instead of a few religious do-gooders, and not only legalise physician-assisted dying, but give legal standing to directives so that even those who can no longer express them can have their wishes respected. Pat de Moulpied, Kyneton Causes of deaths While intimate partner violence is the leading contributor to the burden of disease (death, disability and illness combined), it is not the most common form of death for Victorian women aged 15-44 (""Inside the mind of a whimpering, weeping killer"", 27/3). The most recent data we have (2003) show the top five causes of death for Australian women aged 15-44 were malignant neoplasms (757 deaths), accidents and adverse affects (410), suicide and self-inflicted injury (256), diseases of the circulatory system (248) and diseases of the digestive system (81). That year there were 54 intimate partner violence homicides of women. Greg Andresen, Men's Health Australia, Bondi Junction, NSW Contribution to society Jan Parker (Letters, 31/3), single people without children and those with no intention of having children pay taxes to pay for education they will never use; while those who don't drive pay taxes that go towards building roads. There are plenty of other examples. The government is meant to supply a free, secular education to all children, not help private companies or religious organisations run schools. Bob Graham, Yarragon AND ANOTHER THING... Cricket ""Play up, play up, and play the game."" Once these words meant something. Now all that matters is the win, the binge and the hateful sledge. Disillusionment is now my middle name. Margaret Stratford, Belmont A pyrrhic victory: we won the World Cup and lost the respect of sportsmen throughout the world. Greg Hayes, Talgarno There are many elite athletes young people should be encouraged to look up to; Brad Haddin isn't one of them. Brian Bywater, Warrnambool Although we couldn't hear it, it was obvious Haddin had kind words for each of the dismissed NZ batsmen. Such sportsmanship. Helps us get over the underarm bowling incident. Gerry Cunneen, Khandallah, NZ Tax Only when every last cent of corporate income is repatriated from tax havens will the people be ready for a ""mature conversation"" about tax and listen to lectures about austerity. John Ashton, Healesville Joe wants a ""conversation"" with the public. How are we to reply to him? Vivienne Martin, Coburg Joe, before you raise the GST to 15per cent how about you get everyone to pay the 10per cent. It's a rort. Terry Court, Tatura All aspects open for debate?

17," How Is GST Expected To Affect Real Estate Sector? | Real estate, Best properties, Home Loans, Tax Advice, Interior Design, Investment Tips | NDTV Property Home City Wise News ADVICE BLOGS SHOWS FAQs Property Awards Property Videos Home > How Is GST Expected To Affect Real Estate Sector? How Is GST Expected To Affect Real Estate Sector? August 3, 2016 The Goods and Services Tax (GST), is a kind of a comprehensive indirect tax on sale, manufacture and consumption of different kinds of goods and services throughout India, with all other Central and State taxes intended to be subsumed under it. If this happens, it has far-reaching implications, including on real estate. Taxation and real estate industry If we take a look at the real estate industry in India today, we find that there have been major tax changes in the last few years. However, these taxes are not uniform all over the country – different practices and regulations are followed in different states in India. It was the 46th Amendment to the Constitution that brought massive changes towards taxation in the real estate sector. Later in the following years, special powers were given to the State Government for implementing Value-Added Tax (VAT) on some specific kinds of transactions. For land, property and other kinds of work contracts, different kinds of taxes are levied by the State Government and the Central Government. The transactions are mainly categorized in three parts – value of services, value of goods and materials and value of land. VAT is applied by the State Government on the goods portion, while value of services is taxed by the Central Government. However, other than stamp duty, there is no clear tax on the transactions regarding value of land. This situation leads to confusion and can result in dual taxation. Compliance and implementation of such taxes also get difficult. The real estate industry has justifiably been feeling jittery with such confusing tax implantations and calculations. For one real estate transaction, multiple taxes need to be paid and this has a negative effect on the industry. The industry’s demand to bring GST on board is primarily to get a clear and transparent taxation rule for the real estate sector in India. Expected GST effects on the real estate industry in India The implementation of GST can prove to be a significant step in reforming indirect taxation in India. Chances of double taxation would be diminished, as some of the Central and State Government taxes will be amalgamated into one tax. This will ease the process of taxation considerably, making its enforcement and administration easier and simpler. Talking about the real estate industry in this context, there are many things which have to be known and understood. In the current situation, a builder or a real estate developer incurs various kinds of expenses during the construction phase of a project. Different kinds of taxes are involved with these expenses, such as VAT/CST, customs duties, service tax, excise duty and so on. Majority of these taxes are expenses that are included in the system. This is because they are not creditable to the developer or to the end-customer. These non-creditable expenses lead to tax inefficiency, which is not desirable. One positive impact that might result from GST is doing away of restrictions on credit utilization. This will definitely help in strengthening the credit chain in the entire system. If property developers and builders can properly manage this aspect, they will see some profit. It is expected that the proposed GST structure will have a progressive and streamlined approach. The tax compliance rules should not have any serious impact on real estate builders and developers. In present conditions, builders running projects in different states have to comply with State-specific VAT laws, as well as other kinds of service taxes. Bringing in GST will therefore not bring any additional compliance burden on real estate builders in the country. Issues regarding GST which affect real estate builders There are a few clarifications that might be sought for GST taxation by real estate developers. For instance, the definition of a real estate developer varies from one state to another in India. The composition scheme varies according to State, in which the VAT rates come between 1-5%. In some States, there are differences between the terms real estate contractors and real estate developers. It has to be understood what will the GST implications are if the terms have different meanings. There might be some confusion regarding GST implementations on residential property, as well. In the present scenario, there is no service tax applicable on renting immovable property, particularly for residential purposes. But service tax and VAT is implemented on the construction work. The question that arises is if the proposed GST will offer differential tax for residential properties. As of now, it does not look like completed residential projects will be affected by GST, as buyers into completed projects have already paid statutory charges such as stamp duty and registration charges on the transaction. The segments to watch on the GST front are under-construction flats and rental flats, which are expected to come under the ambit of GST. GST will apply to the materials that a developer procures for building a residential project, so there is a direct correlation to the overall cost of construction. Much depends on what rate of GST will finally be confirmed. If it is more than the existing cumulative taxes currently in force, it means that the overall cost to consumers of buying an under-construction flat will increase along with the added cost of stamp duty and registration. At the same time, developers have to keep an eye on costing, as price competitiveness is very important in the current real estate market scenario.

18," GST bill: Paytm founder says no negative impact, looks to work with the reform - The Financial Express Home Economy GST bill: Paytm founder says no negative impact, looks to work with the reform GST bill: Paytm founder says no negative impact, looks to work with the reform Founder of e-wallet giant Paytm, Vijay Shekhar Sharma said in an interview on Wednesday that the new tax reform in the form of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) will not affect e-commerce companies negatively. By: FE Online | Updated: August 4, 2016 12:02 PM Paytm looks to collaborate with GST and work as a gateway for its transactions. (Reuters) Founder of e-wallet giant Paytm, Vijay Shekhar Sharma said in an interview on Wednesday that the new tax reform in the form of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) will not affect e-commerce companies negatively. He was of the opinion that e-commerce companies are technology based companies and will adjust to the new tax regime as they anyway have to calculate various other taxes and benefits on the basis of the model of products. The industry experts, however,have said that according to the GST, the customer will withhold the tax as he buys, but the tax will be collected at source. In an interview with CNBC TV18, Sharma expressed his concerns about the rules and regulations being ambiguous and hoped that clarity will be provided as the reform is implemented. Sharma said that his company, Paytm is looking forward to working with GST and contribute to payment and tax collections. The company might also collaborate with GST and work as a gateway for its transactions. Since e-wallet companies are technology based, they will be able to provide with better, more integrated ways of tax collection, he added. He opined that it might take the companies 3-6 months to adjust to the new reform, once it is implemented, which includes all compliances and verifications. Sharma believes that the new reform will open new markets in the country, as different taxes in different states complicate the taxation procedure. But the tax rates will have to come with complete clarity, he strongly suggested. He believes that there would be a fundamental change in the market place, once the reform takes place. The GST bill is currently being debated in Rajya Sabha, where it is likely to get passed. The implementation of this reform is said to be starting from April 2017.

Photo: Priyanka Parashar/Mint The goods and services tax (GST) will undoubtedly give India a facelift on the taxation front. Of course, the suspense over the rate at which GST will be levied remains. While it is difficult to quantify the impact on various sectors until the government announces the final GST rate, analysts and economists are assuming a standard rate of 17-18%. If that happens, then companies in the manufacturing sector are expected to benefit, while those in the services sector stand to lose. Also read: GST: The road ahead for industry Of course, even though the bill has been passed in the current session, it will be another couple of years until GST is fully rolled out. As such, it’s premature to conclude how this reform will impact stock prices in the near term. In any case, there are various other factors that impact stock prices, and while GST is an important reform, analysts are more keen about indicators of the economic recovery. The winners 1) Automobiles: The auto sector is likely to emerge as a winner from GST implementation, provided the rate is below the total tax incidence for the sector (>27%). GST is expected to lead to lower prices for the end user and thus boost demand. Companies to benefit include Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. Both stocks have outperformed the market so far this fiscal year. Analysts believe some impact of GST could well be priced in at current levels. 2) Multiplexes: Multiplex companies pay around 25% of the average revenue per user (average ticket price + food and beverage spends, or F&B per head) as taxes, according to Kotak Institutional Equities. This is in three broad areas—(a) entertainment tax on net ticket sales, (b) Value-added tax (VAT) on F&B, and (c) service tax on input costs for which there is no set-off available. No wonder, GST is expected to reduce the tax burden and improve the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin. Stocks of PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd have increased 50% and 30%, respectively, so far in FY17, suggesting the shares are factoring in most of the positives. Of course, there are other factors that are driving these shares. 3) FMCG: If the GST rate is less than or equal to 18%, then it should be positive for most consumer goods companies, point out analysts at Citigroup. Of course, much depends on which exemptions are retained and which of the current excise benefits are “grandfathered”. In addition, there will be gains from warehouse rationalization and a better competitive position vis-à-vis unorganized firms. But gains aren’t expected to be massive and will occur gradually; as such, stocks may not react dramatically just because the GST bill is passed. If cigarettes attract a higher tax incidence under the GST regime, then it will have an adverse impact on companies such as ITC Ltd. 4) Logistics: Supply chain management is expected to get a boost and transit time will reduce. Further, interstate trade barriers would reduce and eventually result in better interstate commerce. Consolidation of warehousing facilities is expected. Stocks that may benefit include Container Corp. of India Ltd and Transport Corp. of India Ltd. Citi’s analysts point out that the better operating environment could lead Gateway Distriparks Ltd to enter the domestic business. 5) Cement: The anticipated 18% GST rate is far lower than what cement companies are paying currently, and analysts expect cement makers to pass on the benefits to consumers as demand continues to remain weak. Whether this alone will help revive demand is another matter altogether. 6) Retail: The opportunity to set off input tax credit on rent is expected to aid margin expansion. But retail companies are facing other problems. Shoppers Stop Ltd’s stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex this year, as underlying demand remains weak and like-to-like sales growth has been lacklustre. Also read: GST reforms: Are companies prepared? The losers As mentioned earlier, services-related sectors are expected to be negatively impacted, as they may have to shell out higher taxes than what they are currently paying. Service tax rate is currently at about 15%. 1) Telecom : The moderate rise in tax outgo could hit demand and revenues. But there would be a simultaneous set-off of taxes (Cenvat, or central VAT) paid on certain capex inputs. So, the impact would be marginal. But telcos have bigger problems. Data volumes are slowing and the Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launch can worsen matters. 2) Consumer staples and discretionary: Many consumer staples currently have low indirect tax. Hence, GST will be negative for companies in food processing, bakery, edible oil, dairy segments and personal care items. Quick service restaurants too will be adversely impacted.

20," Essay on Positive and Negative Impact of GST (Goods and Services Tax) - Short essays on famous quotes Short essays on famous quotes Find inspiration for writing your essay Menu Skip to content Home Essay on Positive and Negative Impact of GST (Goods and Services Tax) Leave a reply Free 516 words Essay on Positive and Negative Impact of GST (Goods and Services Tax) for school and college students. GST stands for Goods and Services Tax levied by the Government in a move to replace all of the indirect taxes. The main idea behind introducing GST is to improve the economy of the nation. A single undivided Indian market would strengthen the economy and make a nation, powerful as well. The Introduction of GST in the country has both the positive and the negative impact. Let us first focus on the positive Impact of Goods & Services Tax: GST is a single taxation system that will reduce the number of indirect taxes. Earlier, indirect taxes were charged as central excise, VAT, service tax, etc. From now, a single taxation term would cover all of those indirect taxes. The Prices of products and services would reduce so this system would prove to be beneficial for the people who are fed up of paying huge prices. This would reduce the burden from the state and the central government. Presently separate taxes are levied on goods and services that you produce. With the introduction of GST, all of these indirect taxes would come under a single roof. Market development. GST would not be charged at every point of sale like other indirect taxes so this way, market would be developed. Corruption-free taxation system. GST would introduce corruption-free taxation system. In the present scenario, the tax is levied at the time of product release from the manufacturing site, and after that retailers also pay it. Positive impact on the Central and the State level According to the latest reports, the introduction of GST would help India to gain $15 billion every year. Let us see how: Improved exports More opportunities for employment Enhanced economy growth Reduced burden on central and state government. Moving on to negative Impact of Goods & Services Tax: According to many economists, the introduction of GST in the country would impact real estate market. This would increase new home buying price by 8% and reduce buyers’ market by 12%. GST levied by the government as CGST for central, SGST for state government are nothing but fantasy terms representing older terms Service Tax, CST, and VAT in a new way. GST is a confusing term where double tax is charged in the name of a single taxation system. Most of the indirect taxes would now start coming under GST. The Central excise tax is levied at the time of Manufacturing but GST is levied till the selling stage. Most of the dealers don’t pay central excise tax and cheat the government by simply paying the VAT. But all of those dealers would be forced to pay GST. Wrapping up There are approx. 140 countries where GST has already been implemented. Some of the popular countries being Australia, Canada,Germany, Japan, and Pakistan, to name a few. Implementation of GST impacts a nation both ways, positively and negatively. Ignoring negative aspects, positive aspects can be taken into consideration, in order to improve the economy of the country.

AUTO Largely positive for demand as it will lead to 10-17% fall in vehicle prices, assuming 18% GST rate. Margin benefits to accrue for tractors as they can claim set-off against taxes paid on input. Organised battery and other spares segment would become more cost competitive and gain market share. Stock Impact: Positive for Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp, Exide, Amara Raja, Eicher Motor, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto. Negative for Ashok Leyland FMCG We view implementation of the GST at a standard rate of 17-18% as positive for stocks in the household and personal care space as the effective tax rate reduces by around 200-500 basis points (bps), apart from reducing warehousing and logistical requirements. We expect companies to absorb these benefits and one should see a one-time margin expansion for companies having a leadership position or a presence in niche and underpenetrated categories. However, certain negative elements do exist in the terms of working capital for retailers, and additional tax rates for jewellery manufacturers and cigarette manufacturers is negative for companies in that space. Stock Impact: Positive for Hindustan Unilever, Emami, Godrej Consumer. Negative for Titan, Bata, ITC LOGISTICS The GST would lead to the elimination of the CST and inter-state VAT arbitrage possibilities . This will lead to consolidation of warehouses and increased efficiencies in the logistics chain. Overall we expect significant reduction in logistics costs across the value chain. 3PL/4PL logistics service providers are expected to gain market share on improved margins as a result of lower trucking costs. Stock Impact: Positive for Container Corporation of India, Adani SEZ, Gujarat Pipav Port (positive in longer term) INFRASTRUCTURE Clarity on works contract taxation is the key benefit for companies like L&T involved in the EPC space. This is expected to eliminate litigation and multiple and varying taxes across states. Further, GST eliminates the need to distinguish between sales and services, a cause of many litigations. Stock Impact: Positive for Larsen & Toubro (L&T) CONSUMER DURABLES GST will benefit consumer durables companies more from the improved logistics and the shift from unorganised to organised . Direct benefits of up to 200-300bps in cost savings may also occur as a result of GST subsuming state and central taxes as well as availability of full input tax credit on service tax pay-outs on advertising. However, we expect that a significant portion of the direct benefits will be passed on the end consumer due to a highly competitive market. Stock Impact: Positive for Voltas, Havells, Crompton Greaves E-COMMERCE We think that the GST is largely mixed to marginally negative for ecommerce companies given 1) it could lead to significant increase in compliance cost especially for companies with a larger seller base and 2) a possible deterrent for smaller sellers to list on the platform given higher WC requirements for sellers and tax deduction at source. For ecommerce companies, we see offsets from 1) reduced working capital requirements, 2) lesser paperwork during transfer of goods interstate and 3) likely reduction in logistics costs from their ability to leverage the hub-and-spoke model more effectively. OIL & GAS Key petroleum products like petroleum crude, natural gas, motor spirit, high speed diesel and ATF have been kept out of the GST regime. For other products, clarity is still awaited. Due to dual indirect tax mechanism, compliance costs are likely to increase. Stock Impact: Neutral. Do not foresee any meaningful change on oil & gas companies CEMENT We expect overall tax incidence on cement sector to decline post GST implementation. Also, the cement sector will also benefit from an expected decline in logistic costs, in our view. While we expect cement companies to pass on the benefits, given that cement demand and plant utilisation levels are picking up, cement companies may retain some of the benefits. Stock Impact: Positive for most companies Read also Invest in your Child’s Dreams: Best Investments for your Child’s Education WIND POWER GST will be negative for WTG manufactures like Suzlon and InoxWind as pressure on developer margins and IRRs may eventually force reduction in WTG prices and hence realizations . The extent of the impact may be up to 10-13% in terms of lower realization. However, in case WTG components make their way into the exemption list, the impact of the GST is largely nullified. Stock Impact: Negative for Suzlon, Inox Wind UTILITIES Exclusion of ‘sale of electricity’ from the purview of the GST would potentially raise the cost of coalfired electricity & renewable energy for Discoms. Profitability of IPPs selling via medium/long-term PPAs is unlikely to be dented as the cost escalation would likely be a pass- through on account of the ‘change in law’. Stock Impact: Positive for CESC. Negative for JSW Energy PHARMA We expect the GST rollout to have a negative impact on the sector as this is likely to increase the indirect tax burden. Our analysis based on a simplified model and assuming 18% GST rate suggests indirect taxes paid by Pharma companies can increase by 60% and MRP (end price to consumer) can go up by 4% . If Pharma companies are to absorb this price inflation, the domestic formulations EBITDA margins could see an impact of almost 20%. Stock Impact: Negative for Alkem, Glaxo Pharma Posted on August 2, 2016 Author Kirang Gandhi Categories equity , Financial litercy , Financial planning , Tax Tags equity , Financial litercy , Financial planning , Tax Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

23," Possible negative impact of GST on the SME sector | in HOME FINANCE INDUSTRY NEWS SME EVENTS GOVERNMENT SCHEMES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HUMAN RESOURCE FINANCE Possible negative impact of GST on the SME sector August 16, 2016 August 22, 2016 Teesta Hans 0 Comment The proposed Goods and Services Tax, which is supposedly the biggest tax reform for Indian economy since attaining independence, will be a comprehensive indirect tax on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods as well as services. It will replace numerous the indirect taxes which are levied on goods and services by the Central and State governments separately. We have already captured the positive impact of GST on SMEs. Now, let us look at the other side of the story: The proposed regime does position the SMEs on an equal footing as big corporates by removing the tax differentiation of tax on stock transfers and by neutralising the cascading impact of input taxes. However, the fixation of the threshold limit for tax exemption under the proposed GST regime will have a big impact on cash flow, working capital requirements and compliance requirements for SMEs. Under the current taxation laws, there is no duty required to be paid by a manufacturer having a turnover of less than Rs. 1.50 crore. On the other hand, the proposed GST will bring down the exemption limit to as low as Rs. 25 lakh. This will lead to a large number of SMEs come under the tax scanner which are currently not paying any minimum taxes. Consequently, the SMEs will have to meet additional complianc e requirements in terms of registration and filing of return. This will increase the compliance cost and administrative expenses for SMEs under the GST regime. With decrease in the threshold (from Rs. 1.5 Cr to Rs. 25 lakhs), it will result in additional working capital requirement in the hands of SMEs as they will be required to discharge the liability under the GST for pending realisation of the invoice. Further, in case of supplies to end-consumers, the product cost may increase in the hands of the consumer since the GST levied on such supplies will not be available as input credit to the end-consumer. The exclusion of four crucial state level taxes from GST, namely, tax on petroleum products, electricity duties, excise duty on alcohol, and stamp duty on immoveable property, will have huge implications. The petroleum products constitute a significant cost of production for several sectors. If these are kept out of the GST regime, then unnecessary cost inflation will remain. In the similar fashion, the electricity duty will cause cascading effect of taxes. The ‘dual nature’ of GST (CGST and SGST) will face serious issues in the case of tax on supply of alcohol under the GST. It would have been much simpler if taxes on alcohol could be included in the radar of GST. The differential stamp duties across the country will remain out of the purview of GST. This may lead to a rise in the price of land. The cascading effect of the same might be phenomenal. It is not easy to decide whether GST will prove a boon or a bane for SMEs. Only time will tell! ?

The GST law, as it stands now, excludes a major portion of oil & gas industry thereby depriving industry of benefits of GST. Thus, bearing a negative impact on Oil, Gas industry. “The impact of the GST will be negative on the oil and gas industry due to the compliance with dual taxation regimes and non-creditable tax costs,” ICRA analysts K Ravichandran, Prashant Vasisht and Anoop Bhatia said in their report. ICRA also warned that profitability of the sector will have a significant hit. The new tax law does not seek to include oil and gas products as well as tobacco and liquor under its purview.

28," Impact of GST bill on Indian Stock Market – Sowmay Jain Twitter Facebook Linkedin Google+ Sowmay Jain Investor & Blogger Blog Books Newsletter About Ask Sowmay Impact of GST bill on Indian Stock Market July 26, 2016 Sowmay Jain 9 Img - livelaw.in Any changes in the policies change the economic conditions of a nation & that change the market sentiments towards companies & that drive the stock price up/down. Same applies to recent Goods and Service Tax (GST) Bill. Before we have some peek of how the stock market will be affected by this bill , we need to understand what? how? why? where? of GST Bill. Hey! don’t skip this part. It will lay down a base to understand why and how the stock market will get affected by this dynamic bill. What is Goods and Service Tax (GST) Bill is all about? It is an comprehensive indirect tax, levied on goods and services, aimed at replacing all other indirect taxes. France was the first country to introduce this system in 1954. Today, it has spread to over 160 countries. Many countries have a unified GST system. However, countries like Brazil and Canada follow a dual system wherein GST is levied by both federal and state or provincial governments. In India, a dual GST is being proposed wherein a central goods and services tax (CGST) and a state goods and services tax (SGST) will be levied on the taxable value of a transaction. Currently, there are many indirect taxes in Indian economy like Value Added Tax (VAT), Service Tax, Excise Duty, Octroi etc which is collected by municipal, state & central government. But after the execution of GST Bill, there will be only one indirect tax levied on all goods and services possibly at the flat rate of 18% which will be collected by central government (on behalf of both, state and central government). Direct taxes on Income etc will stay unaffected. What are the benefits of GST bill? There are many benefits associated with GST bill which will boost the economy to great extent. It will simplify the tax process. It will curb black money and corruption. It will improve tax governance. It will unify India as a single and united market place. It will bring in sea change in transportation of goods like the number of days will come down, the cost of carry and octroi duty will get reduced. We can expect 5 to 7 percentage gain. It will ease the process of paperwork. It will create a efficiency in trade. It will ease the process of logistics and will create a faster delivery environment. It will simply the study material of taxation in CA (heck, I was frustrated with all the chapters of indirect taxes in CA). These are some major benefits of execution of GST bill. What are some disadvantages of GST bill? Everything have 2 sides, same applies with GST. It will affect some sector in negative way. Some state may lose some tax benefits. Service sector may get affected as service tax will get hiked to 18% from current 14.5%. Execution of GST all over India will a cumbersome. Why does government want to pass GST bill? Implementing GST bill will hike the taxes on service sectors and this will increase the tax revenue of government. Service sector is increasing in India at a high increasing rate . As per the survey, in India, the growth of services-sector GDP has been higher than that of overall GDP between the period FY2001- FY2014. Service sector tax increases ad this sector is also increasing. Tax revenue. It will also curb corruption and black money. It will restore the huge purchasing power in the hands of the consumer, thus self-propelling the economy into a spending and investing cycle. It will attract huge domestic and foreign funds will flood the Indian market so high cash reserve in government treasury. It will also improve the tax-to-GDP ratio by around 1.5 per cent . What ever the benefits exist but still there are many challenges in India to pass the bill. It have been in talk since a long time and is likely to get passed in this monsoon session of parliament. Also, there are many benefits that central government is working to make India a better place like curbing black money, corruption etc. FINALLY. How will GST bill affect the stock market? The implementation of GST is expected to reduce the cost of logistics. This includes costs of transportation as Octroi tax will not be levied separately. The implementation of the GST is expected to simplify the tax structure and make the supply chain more efficient. This would narrow the cost differentials between organized and unorganized sector. The organized sector would be in a better position to compete with the unorganized sector on prices. “It may not lead to an immediate impact on markets, there cannot be an argument about the fact that GST is a big and much-needed structural reform. If passed, this will be a step in the right direction” quoted by Pankaj Sharma, Head of Equities, Equirus Securities. This could shift demand to companies in the organized sector from unorganized players. Hence companies like F inolex Cables , Havells etc that compete with the unorganized sector in products like cables, wires could stand to gain. Some direct benefits are as follows: It will act as a boon for the company and business which often deals with multi-level tax levitation. It will boost the company related to logistics which mainly deals with export and import due to ease in the process of faster delivery. Also, ease of paperwork. It is going to make our tax administration a lot more efficient because you are ultimately collapsing manufacturing taxes through excise duty and service taxes as well as states VATs into a single tax, which obviously brings a lot of efficiencies that can add between 100 bps and 200 bps to GDP in the long run. The sectors to benefit the most would be logistics, E-commerce, automobile, and FMCG among others. Overall, the following stock will benefit the most if the bill passed in this monsoon sessions. GATI Allcargo Logistics Finolex Cables Century Plyboards VRL Logistics Britannia Industries Century Plyboards Inox Leisure Bata India Relaxo Footwear Amara Raja Batteries Balmer Lawrie Pincon spirit PVR Dish TV Exide Industries Havells These are some well-known companies which will directly get affected positively by GST bill (some had already face their saturation level) and still there are many indirect benefits of the bill for other companies. GST will act as a catalyst for market uptrend but it can get capped on the sentiments of hike in federal interest rate in coming months. Updated: Following is the 10 highlights outsourced from ndtv.com: The rate and scope of the long-delayed tax have been agreed upon today by the powerful GST Council, which consists of Mr. Jaitley and his counterparts from different states. The four GST slabs have been set at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% for different items or services. The brackets are steeper than the rates of 6, 12, 18 and 26% earlier proposed by the government. To keep inflation in check, essential items including food, which at present constitute roughly half of the consumer inflation basket, will be taxed at a zero rate. The lowest rate of 5 per cent would apply to common use items. The peak rate of 28% will apply to luxury goods. Luxury cars, tobacco products, and aerated drinks will attract an additional cess on top of the highest tax rate. The additional cess and a clean energy cess will create a revenue pool which will be used to compensate states for any loss of revenue during the first five years of the implementation of GST, Mr. Jaitley said. The Finance Minister pointed out that the average is lower than the 18% demanded by the opposition, in particular by the Congress. Service Tax will go up from 15% to 18 %, said Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia. The tax rate agreed upon today must be now be approved by parliament, which meets from November 16 for the winter session. Parliament has to pass two bills related to GST in the winter session to be on track to roll out of the new indirect tax regime from April 1 next year. Fitment or categorization of items for each slab will be done by officials and will then be approved by the GST council, Mr. Jaitley said. GST does away with indirect levies charged when goods cross state lines and unify India into a single market. You can get the full list of 172 items with respective tax slab information in this PDF file . About Sowmay Jain 58 Articles Hello! I’m from Hub of IT (ha!) Hyderabad, India.

30," Impact of GST on the Indian market Back to money control GROW my MONEY Editor's Pick Master Talk Knowledge Hub Article | Sip - Aug 12, 2016 | 14:45 PM Impact of GST on the Indian market As of now, there are over 15 – 20 different taxes that the consumer directly or indirectly pays for while consuming products like cars, cement, mobile phones and other electronics, etc. Like one of our former prime minister had admitted, only a small percentage of the benefit of the total spend of the government reaches the masses, in this case, the consumer is paying a price much higher than what he should be actually paying due to the leakages in the entire value chain. Not only do consumers suffer due to multiple taxes eating into their hard-earned savings, the economy as a whole also suffers due to the delays that the entire supply chain goes through as goods take longer to reach destinations than they should as they waste idle time on state borders. It’s like having different countries within India when it comes to the movement of goods and services across state borders within India itself. GST (Goods & Services Tax) seeks to bring about a comprehensive tax system for goods and services at a national level. Its key objective is to remove multiplicity of taxes to create a single national taxation system that seeks to pass on the tax to the last stage, the customer. GST is envisaged as a consumption tax so that while buying any items or services you don’t have to worry about the numbers of taxes being charged to you. You don’t have to worry about whether some of these are applicable or not. Going forward you have to pay a single tax for all items. Some of you who may have travelled to countries like Singapore may have experienced in your shopping, dining & consumption of other services. Currently, the government has proposed a GST Council which will examine all the issues relating to goods and services tax and make recommendations to the Central and State Governments on parameters like rates, taxes, cesses and surcharges to be subsumed, exemption lists and threshold limits, Model GST laws, etc. The Council shall function under the Chairmanship of the Union Finance Minister and will have representatives of all state governments as members. Currently, the council has not fixed the GST rate yet. The current recommendation is in ~17-18% range while the revenue neutral rate for the government ( the rate at which the current tax collections will not suffer) is 15.5%. While over a period all goods & services in the country will eventually come under the ambit of GST, currently items like Real Estate, Petroleum & Petroleum products & Precious metals are not being covered. But will it change your life overnight? Does not seem so. In the near term, this could be inflationary as services which are currently taxed lower (and contribute a large part of GDP) will be taxed higher; however, the impact will be transient. Over a medium to longer term however, significant improvement in public finances on this account and reduction of leakages in the system compounded with huge boost to efficiency in domestic production, exports & allocation of resources will benefit overall GDP Growth big time. According to estimates from the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), growth could increase 0.9% to 1.7%. The efficiencies will come from more efficient movement of goods across borders, less idling and leakages (in revenues) & lesser wastages on spoilage. The movement of labour will also become more efficient as manufacturing will be able to build scale where the factors of production are best available in combination. The impact on inflation is expected to be temporary and should be minimal in order to make the GST attractive. The current speculative rates also have a miniscule impact of less than 1% on aggregate inflation. What if GST fails and has it been tried successfully lately? GST is a successful model in Singapore already. Remember the GST refund counter at Changi Airport? The success of the GST model in a developed market is proven. Amongst developing countries, Malaysia recently implemented GST in 2015 and has seen tremendous benefit. While the country expected GST to get 1.9% of GDP as revenue, they ended up getting 2.3% of GDP as revenue. Malaysia is now expecting 3.1% of GDP in GST revenue for 2016. For market investors, the key question is which companies are beneficiaries of this major reform. While it is difficult to assess what impact or quantum of impact will come for each of the impacted companies, largely the following sectors are going to be key beneficiaries – Consumption: Automobile companies are going to benefit big from this in multiple taxes being eased out as well as logistical efficiencies in the form of warehousing cost coming down. FMCG & Durable Goods will of warehousing cost coming down. FMCG & Durable Goods will largely benefit from the warehousing consolidation & multiple interstate levies easing out. consolidation & multiple interstate levies easing out. Logistics & Supply Chain: While the sector may see a mixed bag, supply chain technology companies, containers, and cargo companies could see their business scale up as single-location manufacturing will pick up. Building Materials including Cement & Paints are likely to benefit in form of lower duties; this is one of the higher taxed areas Industrial Manufacturing will also benefit from the lower tax incidence; demand will pick up and better allocation of resources Oil & Gas could face a negative impact since its inclusion is yet to be notified for implementation in GST ambit & could have impact of dual indirect taxation systems till then The impact on remaining sectors is likely to be neutral to positive. For mutual fund investors, manufacturing & consumption themes will remain in focus while aggressive diversified equity schemes will be a good bet from a long term perspective. By when do we get going with GST? GST will end up dismantling & changing a very large indirect tax system built over the years. However, work is underway already for this implementation. For implementation of the GST as planned from 1 April 2017, the same needs to be ratified by 50% of the state assemblies since the Parliament has already cleared it. With BJP-led government in power in 14 states, that shouldn’t be difficult. Three pieces of enabling legislation need to be approved – a central GST law (by Parliament), state GST law (by state governments), and an integrated goods and services tax law (by Parliament). For actual implementation, the IT infrastructure is already under development and testing by Infosys. We all remain hopeful of this implementation and reform playing out as envisaged.

31," GST to have short-lived impact on inflation: RBI | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Locality World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# demonetization Taimur Ali Khan Bigg Boss 10 Christmas 2016 Narendra Modi Home Money GST to have short-lived impact on inflation: RBI (File Photo) Shares 66 Tue, 4 Oct 2016-10:01pm , New Delhi , PTI Reserve Bank endorsed a government panel report that suggested 18% indirect tax rate to keep the impact on prices minimal. Implementation of GST will have a short-lived impact on inflation, the Reserve Bank said on Tuesday while endorsing a government panel report that suggested 18% indirect tax rate to keep the impact on prices minimal. In its 'Monetary Policy Report', RBI said cross country experience suggests that the pass-through of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will likely commence from April 2017 and last for about 12-18 months. It said: ""While the creation of a unified goods and services market would reduce supply chain rigidities, cut down on transportation costs and also bring down costs in general through improvements in productivity, it could also produce a short-lived pass-through to the inflation trajectory."" While the impact of GST on CPI inflation would largely depend on the standard rate decided by the GST Council, almost 50% of the CPI is expected to be exempt. ""Cross-country experience indicates that the GST implementation might have one-off effects, which tend to dissipate after a year of its implementation,"" RBI said. Endorsing Finance Ministry's report on GST structure, RBI said the dual rate GST structure with a standard rate of 18% and a low rate of 12% (consistent with a revenue neutral rate (RNR) of about 15-15.5%) is expected to have a minimal impact on inflation. If the standard rate is increased to 22% (with an RNR of 17-18%), the impact on aggregate inflation would be in the range of 0.3-0.7%, concentrated in select groups like healthcare (excluding medicines). As the standard rate increases from 22% to 26% and 30%, the impact on CPI would increase from 0.6-1.3% and to 1.0-1.9% (with input tax credit), respectively. ""The general consensus is that the impact on consumer price inflation is likely to be moderate if the standard GST rate is at 18% in fact, overall price levels may go down due to more efficient allocation of factors of production,"" it said mentioning an NCAER report. Over the medium-term, RBI said the implementation of the GST should boost business confidence and investment, brightening the environment for an acceleration of growth. Touted as the biggest tax reform since independence, the GST will subsume excise, service tax and other local levies. TOP TOP < India v/s NZ series on?

GST Impact on Insurance Industry in India September 1, 2016 September 29, 2016 CS Urvashi Jain GST Articles , Taxes in India As per the CRISIL’s report(October 2015), the insurance industry of India consists of around 52 insurance companies of which 24 are life insurance and 24 are engaged in non-life insurance companies. India’s Life insurance sector recorded a new premium income of Rs. 1.38 trillion for the period April 2015 to March 2016 indicating a growth rate of 22.5 percent. The insurance sector is likely to grow with the seventh pay commission due to income in hands of people but the question lies here that with the introduction of GST in taxation regime will bring positive or negative impact on the insurance industry. The introduction of GST in taxation regime in India will bring a significant change in the hands of common man. The service sector will be more affected than any other sector. As a result, if you are paying heavy insurance premiums, be prepared for the new taxation structure as it will cost you more as tax rate may rise to 18%(as per the rumors). So, if your premium is currently Rs. 1,000, you may have to pay Rs. 20-30 more. Present Scenario of Taxation in Insurance The insurance plans are bifurcated into two parts i.e. protection and investment. The service tax is levied on the basis of the insurance plan. Have a look at this table for your reference: Scenario after Implementation of GST With the arrival of GST, the Insurance Industry will have a negative impact on the cost of premiums and it will rise due to the increase in tax rate from 15% to 18% in case of term insurance plans, ULIPS, health insurance or motor vehicle insurance. The annuity may rise from 1.5% to 1.8% and Endowments premium for the first-year plan from 3.75% to 4.5% and renewal plan from 1.875% to 2.25%. This change will bring hike up to 300 basis points more in taxes. (1 Base point is equal to one hundredth of a percentage point). Read Also: GST Impact on CA and CS Professional Though the taxation cost will increase with the implementation of GST , but this change may bring down the overall compliance cost as the number of taxes which are part of the premium will merge into one tax. As per the Model GST Law, Input tax Credit shall not be available for life insurance, health insurance when such services are used primarily for personal use or consumption of any employee. Place of Supply for Insurance Services as Per Model GST Law Location of such registered person (i.e. client) for insurance services Location of the service recipient (who is a non-registered person) on the records of the supply of services. From this, we can conclude that it will be a determining factor for the insurance company to identify whether the recipient is registered or not. Insurance Industry is currently facing many challenges, though it has grown in 2016 but compared to earlier years it has shown a decline. The Model GST Law has not defined any particular rate or any provisions related to the insurance sector, the exact position will be determined only after the arrival of the GST Act. So let us see how this will impact the Insurance Industry in the near future.

It will change the indirect tax structure of the nation, taking it towards a single tax system. Goods and Services Tax (GST) will replace the existing central and state taxes levied by the government. It will cover everything including manufacturing, sale or consumption of goods and services. All the authority to administer and levy GST will rest with only one body, the Union Government. One tax system will reduce the tax evasion from the country, giving rise to transparency. Additionally, elimination of inter-state taxes will decrease the procedural compliance and paperwork to a great extent. The consumers will be most benefitted by free movement of goods across the nation and reduction in the tax burden. The successful implementation of the Goods and Service Tax will be a significant phase in India. Overall it can be said that GST will have a substantial impact on the entire working of the industries in the nation. GST in India What is GST? Goods and service tax (GST) is a single rate of indirect tax to be applied in the country. It subsumes all the central and state taxes levied presently in the country into one single tax rate. In India, GST Bill was first introduced in 2014 as The Constitution (122 nd Amendment) Bill. This got an approval in 2016 and was renumbered in the statute by Rajya Sabha as The Constitution (101 st Amendment) Bill, 2016. India being a federal republic, GST will be concurrently levied at Central (CGST) and state (SGST) level. The Union will prepare and implement a common base for both the levels. Destination principle will be considered as a basis for the levy for CGST and SGST. Hence, exports will become zero-rated and import taxes will equalise with domestic goods and services taxes. An Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST) will be imposed on inter-state supplies in the country. IGST will be a sum of CGST and SGST of the relevant state. GST council will be formed for solving all the issues and recommendations relating to GST. Also, an additional tax of 1% will be levied by the Centre for the supply of goods over and above IGST, assigning the income earned to the origin states. For an efficient and fruitful implementation of GST, the government will bear the losses incurred by the states and provide with compensations for five years. GST will reduce the administrative complications and simplify the indirect tax system in India. It will result in a significant change, creating a single national market under one tax procedure. Features The Union Government will be vested with all the powers to make the rules and regulations in the matter of supplies in the system of inter-state trade. For intra-state transactions (including services) the right to levy GST will be with states. GST will contain current Central and state-level taxes in itself. The Central taxes subsumed will include service tax, excise duty, additional excise duty, additional customs duty (CVD) and special additional duty. State VAT, entertainment tax, central sales tax, luxury tax, entry tax (other than Octroi) and purchase tax are state level taxes to be included in GST. Alcohol for human consumption will be kept away from GST. Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST) will be levied by the Centre on the inter-state goods and services. Application of GST on petroleum and petroleum products might happen. Basic customs duty will be levied on goods imported. Provisions relating to removal of Octroi or entry tax across India will be made. GST Council comprising of Central and state ministers will administer the GST in India. The Constitution (101 st Amendment) Bill The Bill introduces the Goods and Service Tax (GST) in the Constitution of India. It highlights the structure of the GST to be implemented. The key features presented in the Bill are scope, levy, construction of GST Council, additional tax on goods supply and compensation given to the states. It is hoped that the Bill will be implemented by 2017. Tax-rate Proposed for GST The central question for the Government is to decide a GST tax rate to be applied. Currently, no tax rate is agreed upon but, Finance Minister has stated that it will be within 17% to 20%. He also promises to keep the GST tax rate as low as possible. Business Impact of GST Implementation The successful implementation of GST will make a revolutionary impact on the economy of India. It might benefit some, and some might have to change their strategy to be successful. GST being one tax for Central and state will give rise to transparency in the functioning of the nation. It will lead to ease of business transactions and will reduce logistics costs across sectors. The impact of GST on various industries can be observed as under: Real estate: Including the industry of real estate within the ambit of GST will result in less malicious acts in this sector. Tax evasion will be reduced as a consequence of the same. GST being one tax will solve the present issue of collecting VAT on excise duty. GST might have a negative impact also by increasing the cost for the consumers in case the output of real estate is exempted from it. Tourism and hospitality: Presently, multiple taxes are levied by the Centre and states for the tourism and hospitality industry. GST will replace all these taxes. GST might change the input credit availability for services used to renovate and construct the hotels and resorts. It is hoped that GST will simplify the procedures. The present benefits from Foreign Trade Policy might not be available and that might increase the costs. Education: Currently, education sector enjoys many exemptions and benefits. It is also a part of the negative list of services, excluding the industry from the service tax ambit. If the exemptions are retained, similar situation is likely to continue in this sector. However, for real benefits to this sector, the taxes to be paid on inputs must be eliminated. Financial Services : GST might result into increasing the cost of the banking and financial services. A service tax of 15% is levied on financial services at present. With the assumed GST tax rate of 18% to 20%, it can be said that services are going to get expensive. A lot many compliance issues might also arise with the application of GST. The banking sector recommends that GST must not cover financial and banking services. It can be said that levy of GST on these services will be too challenging. Hence, GST will arise as transformative step, changing the whole indirect taxation system of India.

(Photo: iStockphoto) Business | 4 min read Here’s How the GST Bill Will Affect YOU, the Consumer S Aadeetya August 4, 2016, 1:08 pm This week’s big news took shape in the form of the goods and services tax (GST) bill, which finally got the go ahead in the Rajya Sabha. In plain and simple terms, GST will be absorbing all the existing forms of taxes that consumers have to pay into one unified tax. This is seen as a positive move by experts across the industry, but what does it really mean for people, especially when it comes to buying phones, car or even new air-conditioner/television? Here’s a quick look at it. Higher Mobile Bills We start off with the bad news. In all probability, users will have to pay more for their mobile bills once the GST is rolled out. Time for the likes of Airtel, Vodafone to mint more money. (Photo: Reuters) A supposed 18 percent GST rate could end up increasing your mobile bills. Currently, the tax rate on telecom operators is fixed at 15 percent. The likes of Vodafone, Airtel, Idea and others stand to benefit hugely with this GST rollout, but in the end, consumers pay the price for it. It remains to be seen if the entry of Reliance Jio 4G has a side effect on the sector; that will surely be good news for the end consumer. Pay Less for TVs, Air Conditioners Cost of television and other white goods will come down. (Photo: The Quint ) The price of consumer durables like air conditioners, refrigerators will see a fall which is a direct impact of the inclusion of the GST bill. The initial impact of the bill will be seen on the logistic and supply chain inventory side. The industry is yet to figure out the actual benefit which can be passed on to the consumer, but any fall in price is always good for the buyer. ‘Make in India’ Comes to the Fore The biggest benefactor of the GST bill will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative. This bill will offer various benefits to companies manufacturing locally, and encourage more companies to do so. The Galaxy S6 Edge smartphone at the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, March 1 2015. (Photo: Reuters) Being a manufacturing entity, Intex Technologies stands to benefit from a uniform tax regime because this will boost operational efficiencies, increase cost savings and make products more competitive. Narendra Bansal, Chairman & Managing Director of Intex Technologies (India) Ltd. PM Narendra Modi attending a ‘Make in India’ meeting. (Photo: Reuters) Having said that, most mobile brands have refrained from commenting on the effect of the GST on their existing tax channels. The likes of Micromax also feel that it is too early to discuss the real impact on the mobile ecosystem but they are quietly confident that the tax structure will become more transparent and less complex going forward. The calculation of pricing will remain speculative till the final GST rate on each product category is known. However, with GST, the overall taxes on goods are likely to come down and make them cheaper. Cheaper Cars in the Offing And yes, the rollout of GST will also come with the prospect of buying two-wheelers and four-wheelers on the cheap. Industry experts foresee a 10-17 percent fall in prices. Maruti Vitara Brezza. (Photo: The Quint ) GST is expected to drive overall consumer demand since the cost for the logistics and supply chain inventory will be curtailed by almost 30-40 per cent, the benefits of which are expected to be passed on to the consumers Sumit Sawhney, Country CEO and Managing Director, Renault India Download TheQuint App About Us Advertise With Us Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Powered by Quintype 2016 © Copyright TheQuint "

Close Close Panel Of Experts Case Studies Press Contact Search Analysis by Elargir Solutions on Impact of GST in Retail Sector In Newsletter by admin August 8, 2016 0 Comments Analysis by Elargir Solutions on Impact of GST in Retail Sector Marking an end to the long and tumultuous debate on GST, the Rajya Sabha has finally approved the crucial Indian Constitutional amendment to turn the bill into law. The LokSabha had already passed the key bill. The bill will now go back to the Lower House to incorporate the amendments approved by the Rajya Sabha and will have to be approved by 50 per cent of all the state assemblies. Retail Sector would be one of the highest benefiting sector from GST bill, waiting for long now to finish the cascading impact of taxes for the growth of the Industry. With GST, the journey from manufacturer to retailer and to end consumer would simplify and generate savings including the logistics, warehousing, distribution and retailing. While there are positive and neutral impacts on retail and related industries, many sectors like telecom would be adversely impacted. From a short term perspective, the GST might have a minor impact on the inflation; in the longer run it will reap more benefits for the economy attracting high investments across sectors. For initial years, the central government would be managing the finance compensating all the states for 5 years incurring revenue losses. Before going into business technicalities, let us make you understand as to how it will have a direct impact on prices, with the following simple case of apparel sector.

Whereas, the final price to the user/customer under the GST regime is Rs 166 , which includes a total tax of Rs 16. DIRECT POSTIVE IMPACT ON RETAIL & RELATED INDUSTRIES SUPPORTING RETAIL 2.1. Rentals are one of the main costs of retail services sector attracting a service tax at 14.5% on total rental cost. Currently, the retailers cannot set off these costs like the other industries. Under GST, taxes on services would be available for set off against taxes on goods. With this move, the tax burden to be paid on the rental would benefit the cash flow and profitability of the lessee and retailers. 2.2. Overall, Purchasing price explained in above GST scenario would reduce the tax burden and overall pricing & better margins. 2.3. Simplification of taxes and getting GST in the country would attract more FDI’s and FII’s investments, GST being the globally accepted tax structures. 2.4. Overall retail inflation would reduce, making industry more competitive with no cascading effect cutting across states. 2.5. FMCG sector with Companies like HLL, Colgate, would be able to generate benefits in logistics and distribution by eliminating the multiple sale depots and distributions centres. Currently, they pay around 25% taxes including VAT, entry tax and Excise duty and GST being @ 17-19% would be significant reduction in tax cost to them. As a result, a significant portion of direct benefits will be passed on to end consumers because of a highly competitive market. 2.6. E-commerce would get additional Push for growth by making processes Integrated across the country and elimination of cascading effect of taxes on customers bringing efficiency in the prices. GST would allow free movement of goods across country. 2.7. Automobiles service industry would have drop in prices by filtering the taxes. 2.8. Mobile phone & Handset prices likely to come down/even out across states. Manufacturers are also likely to pass on to consumers cost benefits they will get from consolidating their warehouses and efficiently managing inventory. For handset makers, GST will bring in ease of doing business as they may no longer need to set up state specific entities and transfer stocks to them and invest heavily into logistics of creating warehouses in each state across the country. NEGATIVE IMPACT OF GST FOR THE OTHER INDUSTRIES 3.1. For Pharmacy retailers, GST rollout could be negative, as it is likely to increase indirect tax. Indirect taxes paid by pharmacy companies could increase by 60 per cent and MRP by four per cent. This would increase the price of the Medicines for Consumers 3.2. IT companies can have several delivery centres and offices working together to service a single contract. With GST, companies might require each centre to generate a separate invoice to every contracting party. Duty on manufactured goods is going to go up from existing 14-15% to 18%, which means the cost of electronics from mobile phones to laptops- will rise. 3.3. Consulting Services, currently paying 15% as service tax would have the negative impact after high rate of GST @ 18-20% 3.4. With Insurance policies of life, health and motor costing more from April 2017 as taxes will go up by up to 300 basis points, it is going to affect the overall price to the end consumer 3.5. For food companies, if the recommended 40% “sin/demerit” GST for aerated beverages and tobacco products is levied and then prices may increase by over 20%. They many see increase in effective tax as many companies enjoy concessional rate of excise. 3.6. In Telecom sector, the Call charges, data rates will go up if tax rate in the GST regime exceeds 15%. Tower firms won’t be able to set off their input duty liabilities if petro-products continue to stay outside GST framework. 3.7. Key petroleum products like crude, natural gas, high speed diesel and ATF have been kept out of GST. Clarity is awaited for others. Compliance costs are likely to rise because of dual indirect tax mechanism. 3.8. GST will be negative for wind, turbine generator manufactures like Suzlon and InoxWind, as pressure on developer margins and internal rates of return could eventually force reduction in prices and realisations, up to 10-13 per cent. However, if components are included in the exemption list, the impact of GST will be nullified. 3.9. In Utilities Exclusion of “sale of electricity” from GST could potentially raise the cost of coal-fired and renewable energy for Discoms. Profitability of independent power producers selling via medium/long-term PPAs is unlikely to be dented as cost escalation would likely be passed on. TAXES GST WOULD REPLACE 4.1. Central taxes that The GST will replace 4.1.1. Central Excise Duty 4.1.2. Duties of Excise (medicinal and toilet preparations) 4.1.3. Additional Duties of Excise (goods of special importance) 4.1.4.

Effect of GST on Different Sectors and Industries With the implementation of GST , it will turn India into unified market, which will be benefited to all kind of business leading Logistics companies, airline industry, telecom sector and so. Though some companies will have positive impact, on the other side, imposing GST will lead to negative impact on some companies. As of now, the rate of GST is yet to be decided, it can assume a 20% rate by government panel in decision making. AUTOMOBILES As assumed GST rate near about 20%, which will lead to fall in prices say, about 10-15 %, which will result in positive demand for automobiles. Positive impact on : Maruti Suzuki, hero Crop, Eicher Motor, Mahindra & Mahindra Negative impact : Ashok Leyland FMCG Introduction of GST, it will positively for household and personal care as it will reduce tax rate by 2%-5% excluding warehousing and logistical requirements. Positive impact on : Hindustan Unilever, Emami, Godrej Negative impact : Cigarette manufacturer, Titan, ITC LOGISTICS GST is the tax that will eliminate central sales and inter state VAT which will lead to increase efficiency of warehousing and logistics chain. Positive impact on : Corporation of India, Adani SEZ INFRASTRUCTURE Larsen & Toubro will be key beneficial for this sector as it will eliminate the difference between sales and services. CONSUMER DURABLES Voltas, Havells, and other consumer durables will be benefit as it will be cost saving upto 2-3 % and will be passed on to end users OIL & GAS Petroleum Product l ike: Crude, Natural Gas, Diesel, etc . shows neutral impact as for now no clarity is there in roadmap as GST will follow Dual Mechanism concept. CEMENT Most of the companies in this sector like : Ultratech, Ambuja Cement will have positive impact as current rate is about 27% and assumed GST rate is 20%, so overall tax could decline. WIND POWER Introducing GST, will show some negative impact on Wind Power Sector; Turbine Generator as it will put pressure on some companies to lower their prices . PHARMACEUTICALS Companies like : Alkem, Glaxo Pharma and so, will have negative impact as it will likely to increase indirect tax and companies could increase by 60% and MRP by 4%, as current rate is around 15% and post GST, it will be 20% TEXTILES At present , this sector has been divided into 9 categories for the taxation purpose and tax rate is 4%-12% based on the categories. So with GST, there will be no such categories and only one rate is applicable. REAL ESTATE Real Estate sector will be seen positive as it will reduce the prices in properties. In current scenario, developers/ builders have to pay various taxes like custom, excise, entry tax, and so, and for the same customer has to pay service tax and VAT for the purchase of property. So with GST, it will replace all the taxes. HOTELS Hotel Industry will show Neutral effect , as GST rate is 20% and the service charge by this industry is 8% and luxury tax will be 10-12%, so it’s not majorly affected.

A new single tax will greatly simplify the myriad of taxes currently being enforced by different agencies at different stages of the manufacturing and distribution process. At the same time, some sectors might be negatively affected by an increase in the taxation rate. Here are some points that procurement gurus need to consider about how GST implementation will affect them: 1. Easier interstate movement of goods Purchasing across states is set to become a lot more hassle free as a unified tax structure will allow for seamless movement across state borders. Currently interstate logistics is a major pain area with a long queue of trucks waiting for clearance by state tax and octroi authorities is a common sight on Indian highways. This will soon be relegated to the past as free movement of goods will be possible within India. It is estimated that this will reduce distribution costs by as much as 10-15% and reduce the time taken for transport at the same time. Along with lesser inventory to be maintained due to shorter transport times, this will also open up a wider base of suppliers that will push costs further down. 2. Prevention of Double Taxation In the current system, VAT, CST, Excise, Octroi is being levied by different state and central government authorities. Some of these taxes are levied on top of other taxes, which leads to a cascading effect. This drives up the cost of goods significantly. With one single tax being paid, it is expected that the cost of goods could see a significant reduction (based on the tax rate for GST). This cost benefit could then be passed on to the customers, which will indirectly result in an increase in consumption. Moreover, availability of input tax credits will drastically reduce the tax burden on businesses. 3. Uncertainty on Tax Incentives Certain industries or companies which have been given tax incentives (for eg. Tax holiday for 10 years on all earnings and concessional VAT and Sales Tax for renewables in the energy sectors) might have to forego these incentives with the emergence of a single tax. The government is still working on a framework to manage these incentives. But, there remains the possibility that certain input costs might see an increase. Currently several supply chains are designed to make maximum benefits of these incentives. These might have to be completely restructured to minimize costs to the company. 4. Ease of Doing Business with SME’s Almost all Indian corporations, no matter how large, have a large number of SME suppliers. Though previously, SME’s had a lot of tax incentives, now they will be able to claim input tax credits on the entire tax amount paid by them. This will, in effect, lower the tax burden on them, leading to a reduction in the price. Also, previously, SME’s operated locally, generally restricted to the state where they were based, due to lack of resources. Now, with a uniform pan India tax, SME’s will find it much easier to conduct business across state boundaries. The exact implications of GST will unravel over the coming months and years. However, it will go a long way in improving the business atmosphere in India and will have a largely positive outcome in the long term.

Business Incubator Support Services » Company Formation Manufacturing Set Up Office-in-Office Registration Recruitment Case Studies News Events Contact Us Effects of GST on India’s Healthcare Industry Home / Effects of GST on India’s Healthcare Industry Effects of GST on India’s Healthcare Industry India is not only one of the largest producing countries for generics, but further experiencing a boom in medical tourism which generates additional returns for the Healthcare Industry. India’s Pharmaceutical Industry currently is 3 rd largest in terms of volume and 14 th largest in terms of value globally. As population is continuously growing, so is the need for good Healthcare Services, which brings the need of developing more qualified personnel to fill the current gap in the sector and providing state-of-the-art facilities and technologies to patients. In India, 5% of the GDP is spent on Healthcare – 4% by the private sector. The Indian Healthcare Industry has been exponentially growing in the recent years, and the Ministry of Health targets the development of 50 new technologies by the end of this year to treat diseases, such as cancer and tuberculosis. To attract more foreign direct investment (FDI), the Government raised the FDI cap for brownfield Pharmaceutical investments to 74% in June. Eventually, 100% FDI is allowed in greenfield Pharmaceutical investments and beyond 74% under government approval in brownfield Pharmaceutical investments. Recently, the passing of the most awaited Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill caught the attention throughout all industries in India. It should benefit most sectors and make taxation easier as it replaces several different duties and taxes. What will be its effects on India’s Healthcare Industry? The Healthcare Industry in India has become one of the largest sectors in the country in regards to employment and revenue. As Healthcare expenditure increases, so do the tax revenues for India. Recently, India’s Government decided to implement GST, which will subsume a number of taxes of the complex State and Central Tax system in India into one uniformed tax system. Until now, two out of the required minimum 16 State assemblies, namely Assam and Bihar , have ratified the GST Bill. GST is expected to have a positive effect on the Pharmaceutical sector. It will help the industry by simplifying the tax structure, since eight different taxes are levied in the Pharmaceutical Industry at the moment. A consolidation of all these into one tax would ease doing business, as well as mitigate the cascading effects of multiple taxes applied on one product. Apart from this, GST will also result in operational efficiency by streamlining the supply chain which can alone add 2% to India’s Pharmaceutical market size. Because GST will help Pharmaceutical companies rationalize their supply chain, they will have to review their distribution networks and strategy. Additionally, GST implementation will also envisage a seamless flow of tax credit , account for improvement in overall compliance and is also expected to create a level-playing field for Pharmaceutical companies in India. A big advantage for companies will be the reduction in transaction costs with the discontinuance of Central Sales Tax (CST). GST is expected to bring down the manufacturing cost and even a 2% reduction in production or distribution cost is believed to add over 20% to profits. GST, if its rate is below the current total tax rate, will eventually help consumers by making Healthcare and drugs more affordable which already is a big goal for the Indian Government. The Industry’s present concern is that the rate of GST should be kept at a competitive level in the lowest slab for Pharmaceuticals. Industry analysts speculate a GST rate of up to 12% will have a neutral effect whereas anything above will have an inflationary effect on pricing in the Pharmaceutical sector in the short term. Additionally, it is uncertain if the Healthcare sector as well as life-saving drugs and medical devices and Healthcare services will continue to be exempted from taxation once GST is implemented. Until now, life-saving drugs were exempted from Excise and Customs Duties. Some States currently charge 5% taxes on medicines, this may change overall with GST. The Government should continue the tax and duty incentives which have been already provided, such as the exemption of excise duties in North-East States and Jammu & Kashmir, etc. for manufacturing units, as huge investments have been made and the loss of incentives will negatively impact local economies. As GST is applicable on all phases of the supply chain, it is not clear how this will influence free-drug samples, bonus schemes, inter-state movement of expired products or stock transfers . On the other hand, Pharmaceutical companies will experience improved operational efficiency, reduced manufacturing & transaction costs as well as improved compliance. In addition, it will benefit Pharmaceutical companies’ warehousing strategy . As of now, companies kept warehouses in different States to avoid CST of different States. Now, with CST subsumed under GST, they can consolidate warehouses at strategic locations as they will only have to pay Integrated GST (IGST) on inter-state supplies of Goods and Services. Overall, the effects of GST implementation on the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical sector are still uncertain. However, Industry experts believe that GST will set industry players and consumers in a win-win situation. The Healthcare Industry, in case the tax rate is set at an efficient level, will benefit as GST certainly reduces complexities and removes many hurdles to the industry’s growth. The industry is on a path of promising growth and increased productivity. To read the latest News about the Indian Healthcare Industry, click Healthcare Industry Newsletter .

There is a consensus that categorising as “sin” goods such as tobacco that are harmful to society be taxed at the highest rate under the GST as recommended in the Chief Economic Advisor report which seeks a 40 per cent GST sin rate on all tobacco products, including cigarettes, bidis and chewing tobacco, prominent NGO Voluntary Health Association of Assam (VHAA) said on Tuesday. The VHAA demanded at least 40 per cent sin tax with a provision for the States’ right to impose top-up taxes on all types of tobacco, including cigarettes, bidis, smokeless tobacco and pan masala be imposed to discourage their consumption and addiction amongst people, specially amongst the youth. VHAA executive secretary Ruchira Neog said the GST council meeting that concluded on October 20 last proposed a much lower 26 per cent GST sin rate which would have significant impact on the revenue as well as the health of the nation, both of which require serious consideration. “The rationale for a sin tax is twofold — to pay for the damage caused to society by products like tobacco and secondly to increase the price and reduce their usage,” Ms Neog pointed out. “A 26 per cent rate would defeat both purposes. It would significantly reduce current revenues from tobacco and would actually make tobacco products more affordable and encourage consumption, especially among vulnerable population including children and youth,” she said.

WATCH VIDEO: GST Council Fixes Rates: Find Out More VHAA demanded at least 40 per cent sin tax with a provision for states’ right to impose top-up taxes on all types of tobacco, including cigarettes, bidis, smokeless tobacco and pan masala be imposed to discourage their consumption and addiction amongst people, specially amongst the youth. VHAA Executive Secretary Ruchira Neog said the GST council meeting that concluded on October 20 last proposed a much lower 26 per cent GST sin rate which would have significant impact on the revenue as well as the health of the nation, both of which require serious consideration. “The rationale for a sin tax is twofold – to pay for the damage caused to society by products like tobacco and secondly to increase the price and reduce their usage,” Neog pointed out. “A 26 per cent rate would defeat both purposes.

At least 52.6 per cent of males and 25.3 per cent females in Assam are found to use tobacco in some form or the other, Neog said. A 40 per cent ‘Sin rate’ combined with the existing excise tax and top-up state rights to tax tobacco appears to be the best scenario for public health and revenue, the VHAA Executive Secretary said. “This will not only help us maintain the current tax burden on tobacco but will prevent more Indians from falling prey to life-threatening diseases and caught in a cycle of perpetual poverty,” she said. According to Dr Rijo John, Assistant Professor in IIT Jodhpur, “Compared to a GST Sin rate of 40 per cent, imposing a 26 per cent Sin rate would reduce total tobacco tax revenue by almost one fifth (17 per cent or roughly Rs 10,510 crore) even if the government retains the current excise on tobacco products post GST”. “Clearly, 26 per cent Sin rate will be well below the rate required to maintain a revenue neutral position for tobacco and will significantly reduce tax burden on all tobacco products since the existing average VAT rates themselves are higher than 26 per cent on most tobacco products,” said Dr John working on tobacco taxation and co-author of various reports and studies on tobacco taxation.

Stating Tobacco-use imposes enormous health and economic costs on the country, he said the total economic costs attributable to tobacco use in Assam amounted to Rs 541 crore in 2011 for persons aged 35-69, of which 47 per cent was direct medical costs and 53 per cent was indirect morbidity costs. “A much lower GST rate would make all tobacco products even more affordable to youth and children, leading to the impact of the tobacco epidemic becoming more severe driving up health care costs and resulting in productivity losses”, said Dr Ravindar Singh, President of the Assam Branch of the Indian Dental Association (IDA). “This will certainly lead to an increased number of fatalities per year, which is not good news for any country.

Companies could generate substantial savings in logistics and distribution costs as the need for multiple sales depots will be eliminated ? Photo Credit : Reuters, 04 August, 2016 by Monica Behura Print this article Font size - 16 + With Economic Jitters, Gold Imports Surge 85% GST This Winter? Economy: Three Men Standing Land Reforms Fail, 5% Of India’s Farmers Control 32% Land In the biggest tax reform since Independence, the Goods and Services Tax Bill was on Wednesday (03 August) passed by the Rajya Sabha to replace a raft of different state and local taxes with a single unified value added tax system to turn the country into world's biggest single market. The GST may bring down transaction cost for retail businesses thus helping reduce prices. Analysts expect a strengthening of supply-chain management to bring about lower inflation, which would be crucial for policymakers, given the new inflation targeting framework that India adopted last year, according to a report in Reuters. The new tax regime may not have a uniform impact on all sectors however. At present, the moot question is: Will the GST have an impact on the retail sector? Economists are of the view that in retail sector, the implementation means a seamless integration of goods and service transaction across the states. It will have benefit at different stages of the value chain Positive Impact Companies could generate substantial savings in logistics and distribution costs as the need for multiple sales depots will be eliminated. FMCG companies pay nearly 24-25 per cent including excise duty, VAT and entry tax. GST at 17-19 per cent could yield significant reduction in taxes. Warehouse rationalisation and reduction of overall tax rates, is expected to generate saving which could cumulatively range between 200-300bps. If the GST rate is less than or equal to 18 per cent, then it should be positive for most consumer goods companies. Of course, much depends on which exemptions are retained and which of the current excise benefits are “grandfathered”. In addition, there will be gains from warehouse rationalization and a better competitive position vis-à-vis unorganized firms. But gains aren’t expected to be massive and will occur gradually; as such, stocks may not react dramatically just because the GST bill is passed. If cigarettes attract a higher tax incidence under the GST regime, then it will have an adverse impact on companies such as ITC Ltd. Negative Impact If the recommended 40 per cent ""sin/demerit"" GST for aerated beverages and tobacco products is levied, then prices may increase by over 20 per cent. Food companies: many see increase in effective tax as many companies enjoy concessional rate of excise. “GST will make India a truly common economic market. It will accelerate economic growth. The impact on each sector however will be different. The real challenge now will be to have rational GST law and Rules to ensure that objective of GST is met. Equally important is that tax rate should be moderate to avoid inflation,’ said Nihal Kothari, Executive Director, Khaitan & Co.

The consumers are worrying of the significant price increases on basic needs when the GST has fully implemented. With the relatively high living costs particularly in main big cities like Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru, significant price increases due to GST is considered as another burden for middle income earners. Therefore, the main objectives of this study is; first, to obtain a comprehensive overview on consumer readiness, perceptions and acceptance of GST; and secondly to analyse the households' potential consumptions (purchases) behaviour if GST is introduced. Data was collected through a structured survey among middle income earners. The proposed monthly income threshold is between RM2,000 (USD667) to RM4,000 (USD1,333) as suggested by Bank Negara Annual Report 2008. Respondents were chosen randomly from various organizations including government and private sectors from various locations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This study is expected to suggest a proposal to the relevant authorities on the social and economy impacts on those groups so that the authorities could develop strategies in order to reduce the financial burden of middle income earners in Malaysia if GST is implemented. This study is also expected to make a contribution to the tax administration and policy developments literature by demonstrating the impact of a new tax policy in a developing country in order to facilitate low income earners to survive in competitive environment. This study further contributes by providing comprehensive overview on consumer readiness, perceptions and acceptance of GST in a developing country, particularly in Asian countries that were previously under researched.

Therefore, we conclude that the implementation of the current flat rate of GST is least efficient in collecting the higher revenue and stimulate growth in developing countries.

The result is aligned with the previous studies such as Saira et al., (2010); Palil and Ibrahim (2011) which suggest that the level of respondent's awareness were associated with the tax knowledge. Thus, respondents who are lack of knowledge relating to tax will have negative perception towards tax imposed; indirectly their acceptance towards GST will be affected. "" [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The national budget of Malaysia 2014 had been tabled in Parliament on 25 October 2013 proposing that GST would be implemented commencing on 1 April 2015 at 6% rate. Many people, including educators, were skeptical of their purchasing capabilities as well as the other effects on them. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the level of awareness and the differences on the acceptance among educators' regarding GST implementation in Malaysia.

47," Explaining GST and its impact Services Mutual Fund Advice FundsIndia Select Funds Tools Funds Explorer Calculators Join for free Sign in Marketplace - FundsIndia Official blog of FundsIndia.com Mutual funds Features Equities Insurance Recommendations General Advisory Personal finance Data Simply Important Explaining GST and its impact (Part II) By Lakshmeenarasimhan S on August 6, 2016 in Equities , General GST and its possible impact on sectors The stock market may have reacted in a lukewarm manner to the amendment of the Constitution (in Rajya Sabha) to introduce GST as a bill. This is because GST implementation can have a mixed impact across sectors. A direct impact would of course be an increase or decrease in the rate of tax compared with what each sector is currently paying. But a bigger, although more indirect impact would be the economies coming from a more efficient supply chain management. The latter would be the game changer in terms of which sectors make the most of such efficiencies. Let’s look at the possible impact of GST in some sectors. Auto In the case of two wheelers, if the current taxes at 24% fall to 18%, manufacturers will likely pass on at least a part of such reduction to customers. This could spur demand for two wheelers and entry level passenger vehicles thus increasing sales volume for companies. However, there could be a marginally negative impact on the commercial vehicle space. Since GST is expected to ease movement of goods within the country and remove logistical bottle necks it may increase commercial vehicle fleet productivity thereby reducing the need for adding too many vehicles in the fleet. Consumer goods A big positive that the consumer segment will experience is the input credit on services that will now be available. This can aid margin expansion for companies. Currently retailers incur about 10% to 15% of their operating expenditure on rent on which service tax is levied. The retailers do not currently avail input credit on such service tax as they collect only VAT. Tobacco and precious metals will be impacted negatively; as an expected increase in price of the final product will be borne by the consumer, which can result in lower demand. Open a FREE Account Now! Logistics GST is expected to create a single market for the whole nation. All the logistic companies can now focus on creating regional hubs rather than maintaining warehouses in each state to comply with the local taxes. The logistics industry can therefore be expected to become more efficient with better usage of warehouses whilst bringing in higher level of automation. Transit time of goods between states is expected to reduce significantly as interstate check points where the freights are stalled to apply appropriate duty will be removed. This will also help bring down the cost of logistics companies. Here again, it will be the organised players who will be one up in terms of gaining from the efficiencies arising from GST implementation. Capital goods Lower taxes of 18% from the current 29-30% will help in the reduction of prices of the final output in the light electrical sector, leading to volume growth. In the industrial capital goods segment, lower cost of capex (as engineering goods become cheaper) can be a driving factor to revive investments by companies, provided a low interest rate scenario prevails when GST is implemented. Cement A reduction in the tax rate from the current 23-25% to 18% can lead to a benefit of Rs 300-500/ton. The cement sector currently operates on a carry and forward mechanism through agents to save on central sales tax to establish reach. Carry and forward agents store the final inventory in their warehouses and transport it to the required location. With the implementation of GST, CST will be subsumed and the entire distribution will happen only on actual business requirement resulting in savings through lower inventory carrying and distribution cost. Media Multiplexes pay a multitude of taxes in the form of entertainment tax, service tax and VAT. All these will now be subsumed if GST is implemented. Overall, this could work positively for the sector despite an increase in tax on advertising revenue (where service tax thus far paid will see an increase). DTH operators can benefit from lower effective tax rates as state levied entertainment tax and service tax will get subsumed. Metals The demand for metal products is slightly price inelastic; meaning an increase or decrease in prices of metal may not adversely affect the demand. Demand in this space is more driven by capex plan and production capacity levels in various sectors. The tax burden for this sector can raise from the current 16% to 18%, but may not have much impact. The benefit for this sector will accrue from the various taxes such as entry tax, octroi and CST on their inputs getting subsumed. Telecom Increasing tax rates from 15% to 18% will be mildly negative for the sector. This would be passed on fully to the post paid subscribers . While in the case of pre paid, if the impact is not passed on immediately, it may affect the realisation per minute in the medium term for companies.Also, it is noteworthy that the government wants to ensure that the end consumer is not overwhelmingly burdened with tax hikes. To this extent, sectors that have higher rates may find it hard to pass it on to the consumer immediately. Open a FREE Account Now! Banking and financial services Fee based services will now attract tax at 18% instead of 15% currently. This will result in increase in loan processing cost, insurance premium, and credit card charges as the banks pass it on to the consumers. Hence while it may be neutral for the sector, consumers may feel the pinch here. Information technology The Indian IT industry derives 74% of its revenues from exports which is currently exempt from service tax. This will continue under GST as well. Of the total revenue negligible amount of it is derived from hardware sales and hence its impact will be neutral. Get FundsIndia's articles delivered straight to your inbox!
